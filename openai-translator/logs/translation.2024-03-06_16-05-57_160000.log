 The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway
www.Asiaing.com
To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

“I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”
“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”
“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
“He hasn’t much faith.”
[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”
“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff
home.”
“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he
was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did
not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted
their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful
fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried
them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

“I remember everything from when we first went together.”
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’s
and your mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.”
“May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.”
“I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.”
“Let me get four fresh ones.”
“One,” the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they
were freshening as when the breeze rises.
“Two,” the boy said.
“Two,” the old man agreed. “You didn’t steal them?”
“I would,” the boy said. “But I bought these.”
“Thank you,” the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained
humility. But he [13] knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it
carried no loss of true pride.
“Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,” he said.
“Where are you going?” the boy asked.
“Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.”
“I’ll try to get him to work far out,” the boy said. “Then if you hook something truly
big we can come to your aid.”
“He does not like to work too far out.”
“No,” the boy said. “But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird
working and get
him to come out after dolphin.” “Are his eyes that bad?” “He is almost blind.” “It is
strange,” the old man said. “He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes.” “But
you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.”
“I am a strange old man”
“But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?”
“I think so. And there are many tricks.”
[14] “Let us take the stuff home,” the boy said. “So I can get the cast net and go after
the sardines.”
They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder

and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff
and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff
along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought
alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the
heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local
people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were
needless temptations to leave in a boat.
They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its
open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the
boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room
of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are
called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to
cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy
fibered [15] guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another
of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted
photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too
lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked.
“A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?”
“No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?”
“No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.”
“May I take the cast net?”
“Of course.”
There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went
through
this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this
too. “Eighty-five is a lucky number,” the old man said. “How would you like to see me
bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?” “I’ll get the cast net and go for
sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?”
[16] “Yes. I have yesterday’s paper and I will read the baseball.” The boy did not
know whether yesterday’s paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from
under the bed.
“Perico gave it to me at the bodega,” he explained. “I’ll be back when I have the
sardines. I’ll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.
When I come back you can tell me about the baseball.”
“The Yankees cannot lose.”
“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.”

“Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio.”
“I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland.”
“Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sax of
Chicago.”
“You study it and tell me when I come back.”
“Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow
is the
eighty-fifth day.” “We can do that,” the boy said. “But what about the eighty-seven of
your great record?”
[17] “It could not happen twice. Do you think you can find an eighty-five?”
“I can order one.
“One sheet. That’s two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?”
“That’s easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half.”
“I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg.”
“Keep warm old man,” the boy said. “Remember we are in September.”
“The month when the great fish come,” the old man said. “Anyone can be a
fisherman in May.”
“I go now for the sardines,” the boy said.
When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down.
The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and
over the old man’s shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very
old, and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old
man was asleep and his head fallen forward. His shirt had been patched so many times
that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun.
The [18] old man’s head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in
his face. The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the
evening breeze. He was barefooted.
The boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep.
“Wake up old man,” the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man’s knees.
The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way
away. Then he smiled.
“What have you got?” he asked.
“Supper,” said the boy. “We’re going to have supper.”

“I’m not very hungry.”
“Come on and eat. You can’t fish and not eat.”
“I have,” the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it. Then
he started to fold the blanket.
“Keep the blanket around you,” the boy said. “You’ll not fish without eating while I’m
alive.”
“Then live a long time and take care of yourself,” the old man said. “What are we
eating?”
“Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew.”
[19] The boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the Terrace.
The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin
wrapped around each set.
“Who gave this to you?”
“Martin. The owner.”
“I must thank him.”
“I thanked him already,” the boy said. “You don’t need to thank him.”
“I’ll give him the belly meat of a big fish,” the old man said. “Has he done this for us
more than once?”
“I think so.”
“I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is very thoughtful for
us.”
“He sent two beers.”
“I like the beer in cans best.”
“I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the bottles.”
“That’s very kind of you,” the old man said. “Should we eat?”
“I’ve been asking you to,” the boy told him gently. “I have not wished to open the
container until you were ready.”
[20] “I’m ready now,” the old man said. “I only needed time to wash.”
Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was two streets
down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good
towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter
and some sort of shoes and another blanket.

“Your stew is excellent,” the old man said.
“Tell me about the baseball,” the boy asked him.
“In the American League it is the Yankees as I said,” the old man said happily.”
“They lost today,” the boy told him.
“That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again.”
“They have other men on the team.”
“Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between Brooklyn and
Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives
In the old park.”
“There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen.”
“Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace?”
[21] “I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to
ask him and you were too timid.” “I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone
with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives.” “I would like to take the great
DiMaggio fishing,” the old man said. “They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was
as poor as we are and would understand.” “The great Sisler’s father was never poor and
he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age.” “When I was your
age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I
have seen lions on the beaches in the evening.”
“I know. You told me.”
“Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?”
“Baseball I think,” the boy said. “Tell me about the great John J. McGraw.” He said
Jota for J.
“He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough
and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as
baseball. At least he carried lists of [22] horses at all times in his pocket and frequently
spoke the names of horses on the telephone.”
“He was a great manager,” the boy said. “My father thinks he was the greatest.”
“Because he came here the most times,” the old man said. “If Durocher had
continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager.”
“Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?”
“I think they are equal.”
“And the best fisherman is you.”

“No. I know others better.”
“Que Va,” the boy said. “There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But
there is only you.”
“Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will
prove us wrong.”
“There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say.”
“I may not be as strong as I think,” the old man said. “But I know many tricks and I
have resolution.” “You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I
will take the things back to the Terrace.”
[23] “Good night then. I will wake you in the morning.”
“You’re my alarm clock,” the boy said.
“Age is my alarm clock,” the old man said. “Why do old men wake so early? Is it to
have one longer day?”
“I don’t know,” the boy said. “All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard.”
“I can remember it,” the old man said. “I’ll waken you in time.”
“I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior.”
“I know.”
“Sleep well old man.”
The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off
his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow,
putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the
other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.
He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the
long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high
capes and the great brown mountains. He lived along that coast now every night and in
his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats [24] come riding through it.
He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa
that the land breeze brought at morning.
Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the
boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early
in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the
sea and then he dreamed of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.
He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of
great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places
now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved
them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out
the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated

outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy. He was shivering with the
morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be
rowing.
The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and
walked in quietly with his [25] bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and
the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He
took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him.
The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting
on the bed, pulled them on.
The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the
old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, “I am sorry.”
“Qua Va,” the boy said. “It is what a man must do.”
They walked down the road to the old man’s shack and all along the road, in the dark,
barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.
When they reached the old man’s shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket
and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his
shoulder.
“Do you want coffee?” the boy asked.
“We’ll put the gear in the boat and then get some.”
They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served
fishermen.
“How did you sleep old man?” the boy asked. He [26] was waking up now although it
was still hard for him to leave his sleep.
“Very well, Manolin,” the old man said. “I feel confident today.”
“So do I,” the boy said. “Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits.
He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything.”
“We’re different,” the old man said. “I let you carry things when you were five years
old.”
“I know it,” the boy said. “I’ll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit
here.”
He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were
stored.
The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew
that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a
lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the
day.

The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper
and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and
lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.
[27] “Good luck old man.”
“Good luck,” the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole
pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row
out of the harbour in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going out
to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see
them now the moon was below the hills.
Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except
for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour
and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man
knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the
clean early morning smell of the ocean. He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in
the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well
because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish
congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of
the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools
of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the
wandering fish fed on them.
In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the
trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made
as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his
principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate
dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought,
the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong
ones. Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean
can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so
suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are
made too delicately for the sea.
He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when
they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always
said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys
as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought [29] when the shark livers had
brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a
contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as
feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or
wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a
woman, he thought.
He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his
speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current.
He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he
was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.

I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I’ll work out
where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them.
Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. One bait
was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were
down in the blue
water at one [30] hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait
hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and
all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh
sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on
the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was
not sweet smelling and good tasting.
The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two
deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow
jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the
excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a
big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait
would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made
fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three
hundred fathoms of line.
Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed
gently to keep the [31] lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite
light and any moment now the sun would rise.
The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on
the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was
brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back
at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down
into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water.
He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the
stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that
swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty
fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.
But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who
knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather
be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.
The sun was two hours higher now and it did not [32] hurt his eyes so much to look
into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far
inshore.
All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the
evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the
evening too. But in the morning it is painful.
Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky
ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then

circled again.
“He’s got something,” the old man said aloud. “He’s not just looking.”
He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry
and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he
was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to
use the bird.
The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. Then he dove
suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over
the surface.
[33] “Dolphin,” the old man said aloud. “Big dolphin.”
He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire
leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go
over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line
and left it coiled in the shade of the bow. He went back to rowing and to watching the
long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water.
As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then
swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could
see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping
fish. The dolphin were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be
in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped. It is a big school of dolphin, he
thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has no
chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.
He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements
of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too
fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up [34] a stray and perhaps my big fish is around
them. My big fish must be somewhere.
The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long
green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that
it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in
the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them
go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton
because it meant fish. The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was
higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird
was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some
patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent,
gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating dose beside the boat. It turned on
its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple
filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.
“Agua mala,” the man said. “You whore.”
From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw

 The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
the tiny fish that [35] were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them
and under the small shade the bubble made as it drifted. They were immune to its poison.
But men were not and when same of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there
slimy and purple while the old man was working a fish, he would have welts and sores on
his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak can give. But these
poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash.
The iridescent bubbles were beautiful. But they were the falsest thing in the sea and
the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating them. The turtles saw them,
approached them from the front, then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced
and ate them filaments and all. The old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he
loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on
them with the horny soles of his feet.
He loved green turtles and hawk-bills with their elegance and speed and their great
value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their
armour-plating, strange in their [36] love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese
men-of-war with their eyes shut.
He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many
years. He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff
and weighed a ton. Most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle’s heart will
beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered. But the old man thought, I have
such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs. He ate the white eggs to give
himself strength. He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for
the truly big fish.
He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where
many of the fishermen kept their gear. It was there for all fishermen who wanted it. Most
fishermen hated the taste. But it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose
and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes.
Now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.
“He’s found fish,” he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no
scattering of bait [37] fish. But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air,
turned and dropped head first into the water. The tuna shone silver in the sun and after
he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in
all directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait. They were
circling it and driving it.
If they don’t travel too fast I will get into them, the old man thought, and he watched
the school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait
fish that were forced to the surface in their panic.
“The bird is a great help,” the old man said. Just then the stern line came taut under
his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt tile weight
of the small tuna’s shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in.
The shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the
water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat. He

lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring
as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering
strokes of his neat, fast-moving [38] tail. The old man hit him on the head for kindness
and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern.
“Albacore,” he said aloud. “He’ll make a beautiful bait. He’ll weigh ten pounds.”
He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself.
He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes
when he was alone steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats. He had
probably started to talk aloud, when alone, when the boy had left. But he did not
remember. When he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was
necessary. They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad weather. It was
considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had always
considered it so and respected it. But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since
there was no one that they could annoy.
“If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy,” he said
aloud. “But since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in
their boats and to bring them the baseball.”
[39] Now is no time to think of baseball, he thought. Now is the time to think of only
one thing. That which I was born for. There might be a big one around that school, he
thought. I picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding. But they are
working far out and fast. Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and
to the north-east. Can that be the time of day? Or is it some sign of weather that I do not
know?
He could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that
showed white as though they were snow-capped and the clouds that looked like high
snow mountains above them. The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the
water. The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was
only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines
going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.
The tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished
among them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for
baits, were down again. The sun was [40] hot now and the old man felt it on the back of
his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back as he rowed.
I could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake
me. But today is eighty-five days and I should fish the day well.
Just then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.
“Yes,” he said. “Yes,” and shipped his oars without bumping the boat. He reached out
for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. He felt
no strain nor weight and he held the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a
tentative pull, not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred
fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and the shank of

the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head of the small tuna.
The old man held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand, unleashed it from
the stick. Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension.
This far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought. Eat them, fish. Eat them.
Please eat them.
[41] How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the
dark. Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them. He felt the light
delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine’s head must have been more
difficult to break from the hook. Then there was nothing.
“Come on,” the old man said aloud. “Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren’t they
lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don’t be
shy, fish. Eat them.”
He waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it and the other
lines at the same time for the fish might have swum up or down. Then came the same
delicate pulling touch again.
“He’ll take it,” the old man said aloud. “God help him to take it.”
He did not take it though. He was gone and the old man felt nothing.
“He can’t have gone,” he said. “Christ knows he can’t have gone. He’s making a turn.
Maybe he
has been hooked before and he remembers something of it.
[42] Then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy.
“It was only his turn,” he said. “He’ll take it.”
He was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and
unbelievably heavy. It was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down, down,
down, unrolling off the first of the two reserve coils. As it went down, slipping lightly
through the old man’s fingers, he still could feel the great weight, though the pressure of
his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible. “What a fish,” he said. “He has it
sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it.”
Then he will turn and swallow it, he thought. He did not say that because he knew
that if you said a good thing it might not happen. He knew what a huge fish this was and
he thought of him moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his
mouth. At that moment he felt him stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the
weight increased and he gave more line. He tightened the pressure of his thumb and
finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going straight down.
[43] “He’s taken it,” he said. “Now I’ll let him eat it well.”
He let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and
made fast the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the
next line. Now he was ready. He had three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as

well as the coil he was using.
“Eat it a little more,” he said. “Eat it well.”
Eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you, he thought.
Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you. All right. Are you ready? Have you
been long enough at table?
“Now!” he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of line and
then struck again and again, swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the
strength of his arms and the pivoted weight of his body.
Nothing happened. The fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise
him an inch. His line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his hack
until it was so taut that beads of water were jumping from it. Then it began to make a
slow hissing sound in the water and he still held it, bracing [44] himself against the
thwart and leaning back against the pull. The boat began to move slowly off toward the
north-west.
The fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water. The other baits
were still in the water but there was nothing to be done.
“I wish I had the boy” the old man said aloud. “I’m being towed by a fish and I’m the
towing bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I
can and give him line when he must have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going
down.”
What I will do if he decides to go down, I don’t know. What I’ll do if he sounds and
dies I don’t know. But I’ll do something. There are plenty of things I can do.
He held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff
moving steadily to the north-west.
This will kill him, the old man thought. He can’t do this forever. But four hours later
the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old man was still
braced solidly with the line across his back.
[45] “It was noon when I hooked him,” he said. “And I have never seen him.”
He had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it
was cutting his forehead. He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being
careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the
water bottle with one hand. He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the
bow. He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to
endure.
Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible. That makes no
difference, he thought. I can always come in on the glow from Havana. There are two
more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will come up before that. If he doesn’t
maybe he will come up with the moon. If he does not do that maybe he will come up with
the sunrise. I have no cramps and I feel strong. It is he that has the hook in his mouth.

But what a fish to pull like that. He must have his mouth shut tight on the wire. I wish I
could see him. I wish I could see him only once to know what I have against me.
The fish never changed his course nor his direction [46] all that night as far as the
man could tell from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the old
man’s sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs. During the day he had
taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry. After the sun
went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back and he
cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now. The sack
cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he
was almost comfortable. The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he
thought of it as almost comfortable.
I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought. Not as long as
he keeps this up.
Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and
checked his course. The line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight
out from his shoulders. They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was
not so strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward. If I lose
the glare of Havana we must be going more to the eastward, he thought. For if the fish’s
course held true I must see it for many more [47] hours. I wonder how the baseball came
out in the grand leagues today, he thought. It would be wonderful to do this with a radio.
Then he thought, think of it always. Think of what you are doing. You must do nothing
stupid.
Then he said aloud, “I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this.”
No one should be alone in their old age, he thought. But it is unavoidable. I must
remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong. Remember, no matter
how little you want to, that you must eat him in the morning. Remember, he said to
himself.
During the night two porpoises came around the boat and he could hear them rolling
and blowing. He could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male made and
the sighing blow of the female.
“They are good,” he said. “They play and make jokes and love one another. They are
our brothers like the flying fish.”
Then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked. He is wonderful and strange
and who knows how old he is, he thought. Never have I had such a strong fish nor one
who acted so strangely. Perhaps he is too wise to jump. He could ruin me by jumping or
[48] by a wild rush. But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows
that this is how he should make his fight. He cannot know that it is only one man against
him, nor that it is an old man. But what a great fish he is and what will he bring in the
market if the flesh is good. He took the bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his
fight has no panic in it. I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as desperate as I am?
He remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin. The male fish

always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the female, made a wild,
panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon exhausted her, and all the time the male had
stayed with her, crossing the line and circling with her on the surface. He had stayed so
close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a
scythe and almost of that size and shape. When the old man had gaffed her and clubbed
her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and dubbing her across the top of her
head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then, with
the boy’s aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat. Then,
while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, [49] the male fish
jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down
deep, his lavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide
lavender stripes showing. He was beautiful, the old man remembered, and he had stayed.
That was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought. The boy was
sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly.
“I wish the boy was here,” he said aloud and settled himself against the rounded
planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his
shoulders moving steadily toward whatever he had chosen.
When once, through my treachery, it had been necessary to him to make a choice,
the old man thought.
His choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and
traps and treacheries. My choice was to go there to find him beyond all people. Beyond all
people in the world. Now we are joined together and have been since noon. And no one to
help either one of us.
Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought. But that was the thing that
I was born for. I must surely remember to eat the tuna after it gets light.
[50] Some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were behind
him. He heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff.
In the darkness he loosened his sheath knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his
left shoulder he leaned back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale. Then he
cut the other line closest to him and in the dark made the loose ends of the reserve coils
fast. He worked skillfully with the one hand and put his foot on the coils to hold them as
he drew his knots tight. Now he had six reserve coils of line. There were two from each
bait he had severed and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all
connected.
After it is light, he thought, I will work back to the forty-fathom bait and cut it away
too and link up the reserve coils. I will have lost two hundred fathoms of good Catalan
cardel and the hooks and leaders. That can be replaced. But who replaces this fish if I
hook some fish and it cuts him off?
I don’t know what that fish was that took the bait just now. It could have been a
marlin or a broadbill or a shark. I never felt him. I had to get rid of him too fast.
Aloud he said, “I wish I had the boy.”

[51] But you haven’t got the boy, he thought. You have only yourself and you had
better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and
hook up the two reserve coils.
So he did it. It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled
him down on his face and made a cut below his eye. The blood ran down his cheek a little
way. But it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to
the bow and rested against the wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line
so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his
shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of
the skiff through the water.
I wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought. The wire must have slipped on the
great hill of his back. Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does. But he cannot
pull this skiff forever, no matter how great he is. Now everything is cleared away that
might make trouble and I have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.
“Fish,” he said softly, aloud, “I’ll stay with you until I am dead.”
[52] He’ll stay with me too, I suppose, the old man thought and he waited for it to be
light. It was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be
warm. I can do it as long as he can, he thought. And in the first light the line extended out
and down into the water. The boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose
it was on the old man’s right shoulder.
“He’s headed north,” the old man said. The current will have set us far to the
eastward, he thought. I wish he would turn with the current. That would show that he
was tiring.
When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring.
There was only one favorable sign. The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a
lesser depth. That did not necessarily mean that he would jump. But he might.
“God let him jump,” the old man said. “I have enough line to handle him.”
Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he
thought. Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he’ll fill the sacks along his backbone
with air and then he cannot go deep to die.
[53] He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of
the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned
back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it. I must not jerk it ever, he
thought. Each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might
throw it. Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to look into it.
There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added
drag and he was pleased. It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much
phosphorescence in the night.
“Fish,” he said, “I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before
this day ends.”

Let us hope so, he thought.
A small bird came toward the skiff from the north. He was a warbler and flying very
low over
the water. The old man could see that he was very tired. The bird made the stern of
the boat and rested there. Then he flew around the old man’s head and rested on the line
where he was more comfortable. “How old are you?” the old man asked the bird. “Is this
your first trip?”
[54] The bird looked at him when he spoke. He was too tired even to examine the
line and he teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast.
“It’s steady,” the old man told him. “It’s too steady. You shouldn’t be that tired after
a windless night. What are birds coming to?”
The hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them. But he said nothing of
this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the
hawks soon enough.
“Take a good rest, small bird,” he said. “Then go in and take your chance like any
man or bird or fish.”
It encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly
now.
“Stay at my house if you like, bird,” he said. “I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and
take you in with the small breeze that is rising. But I am with a friend.”
Just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow
and would have pulled him overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line.
The bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him
go. He felt the line [55] carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding.
“Something hurt him then,” he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he
could turn the fish. But when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and
settled back against the strain of the line.
“You’re feeling it now, fish,” he said. “And so, God knows, am I.”
He looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company.
The bird was gone.
You did not stay long, the man thought. But it is rougher where you are going until
you make the shore. How did I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made? I
must be getting very stupid. Or perhaps I was looking at the small bird and thinking of
him. Now I will pay attention to my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I will not
have a failure of strength.
“I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt,” he said aloud.

 The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
Shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed
his hand in the ocean and held it there, submerged, for more than a [56] minute watching
the blood trail away and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat
moved.
“He has slowed much,” he said.
The old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was
afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held
his hand up against the sun. It was only a line burn that had cut his flesh. But it was in
the working part of his hand. He knew he would need his hands before this was over and
he did not like to be cut before it started.
“Now,” he said, when his hand had dried, “I must eat the small tuna. I can reach him
with the gaff and eat him here in comfort.”
He knelt down and found the tuna under the stem with the gaff and drew it toward
him keeping it clear of the coiled lines. Holding the line with his left shoulder again, and
bracing on his left hand and arm, he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back
in place. He put one knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from
the back of the head to the tail. They were wedge-shaped strips and he cut [57] them from
next to the back bone down to the edge of the belly. When he had cut six strips he spread
them out on the wood of the bow, wiped his knife on his trousers, and lifted the carcass of
the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard.
“I don’t think I can eat an entire one,” he said and drew his knife across one of the
strips. He could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped. It
drew up tight on the heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust.
“What kind of a hand is that,” he said. “Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a
claw. It will do you no good.”
Come on, he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line.
Eat it now and it will strengthen the hand. It is not the hand’s fault and you have been
many hours with the fish. But you can stay with him forever. Eat the bonito now.
He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly. It was not
unpleasant.
Chew it well, he thought, and get all the juices. It would not be had to eat with a little
lime or with lemon or with salt.
“How do you feel, hand?” he asked the cramped [58] hand that was almost as stiff as
rigor mortis. “I’ll eat some more for you.”
He ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two. He chewed it carefully and
then spat out the skin.
“How does it go, hand? Or is it too early to know?”
He took another full piece and chewed it.

“It is a strong full-blooded fish,” he thought. “I was lucky to get him instead of
dolphin. Dolphin is too sweet. This is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it.”
There is no sense in being anything but practical though, he thought. I wish I had
some salt. And I do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left, so I had better
eat it all although I am not hungry. The fish is calm and steady. I will eat it all and then I
will be ready.
“Be patient, hand,” he said. “I do this for you.”
I wish I could feed the fish, he thought. He is my brother. But I must kill him and
keep strong to do it. Slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedge-shaped strips of
fish.
He straightened up, wiping his hand on his trousers. “Now,” he said. “You can let the
cord go, hand, and I will handle him with the right arm alone until you [59] stop that
nonsense.” He put his left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back
against the pull against his back.
“God help me to have the cramp go,” he said. “Because I do not know what the fish is
going to do.”
But he seems calm, he thought, and following his plan. But what is his plan, he
thought. And what is mine? Mine I must improvise to his because of his great size. If he
will jump I can kill him. But he stays down forever. Then I will stay down with him
forever.
He rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers. But
it would not open. Maybe it will open with the sun, he thought. Maybe it will open when
the strong raw tuna is digested. If I have to have it, I will open it, cost whatever it costs.
But I do not want to open it now by force. Let it open by itself and come back of its own
accord. After all I abused it much in the night when it was necessary to free and untie the
various lines.
He looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now. But he could see the
prisms in the deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and the strange undulation
of the calm. The clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and
saw a [60] flight of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water, then
blurring, then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea.
He thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boar and
knew they were right in the months of sudden bad weather. But now they were in
hurricane months and, when there are no hurricanes, the weather of hurricane months is
the best of all the year.
If there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead, if you
are at sea. They do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for, he
thought. The land must make a difference too, in the shape of the clouds. But we have no
hurricane coming now.
He looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly piles of ice cream

and high above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high September sky.
“Light brisa,” he said. “Better weather for me than for you, fish.”
His left hand was still cramped, but he was unknotting it slowly.
I hate a cramp, he thought. It is a treachery of one’s [61] own body. It is humiliating
before others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it. But a
cramp, he thought of it as a calambre, humiliates oneself especially when one is alone.
If the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm, he
thought. But it will loosen up.
Then, with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw
the slant change in the water. Then, as he leaned against the line and slapped his left
hand hard and fast against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.
“He’s coming up,” he said. “Come on hand. Please come on.”
The line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of
the boat and the fish came out. He came out unendingly and water poured from his sides.
He was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the
stripes on his sides showed wide and a light lavender. His sword was as long as a baseball
bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the water and then
re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the old [62] man saw the great scythe-blade of
his tail go under and the line commenced to race out.
“He is two feet longer than the skiff,” the old man said. The line was going out fast
but steadily and the fish was not panicked. The old man was trying with both hands to
keep the line just inside of breaking strength. He knew that if he could not slow the fish
with a steady pressure the fish could take out all the line and break it.
He is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought. I must never let him learn his
strength nor what he could do if he made his run. If I were him I would put in everything
now and go until something broke. But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who
kill them; although they are more noble and more able.
The old man had seen many great fish. He had seen many that weighed more than a
thousand pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life, but never alone. Now
alone, and out of sight of land, he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and
bigger than he had ever heard of, and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws
of an eagle.
[63] It will uncramp though, he thought. Surely it will uncramp to help my right
hand. There are three things that are brothers: the fish and my two hands. It must
uncramp. It is unworthy of it to be cramped. The fish had slowed again and was going at
his usual pace.
I wonder why he jumped, the old man thought. He jumped almost as though to show
me how big he was. I know now, anyway, he thought. I wish I could show him what sort
of man I am. But then he would see the cramped hand. Let him think I am more man

than I am and I will be so. I wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has
against only my will and my intelligence.
He settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the
fish swam steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water. There was a small
sea rising with the wind coming up from the east and at noon the old man’s left hand was
uncramped.
“Bad news for you, fish,” he said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his
shoulders.
He was comfortable but suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all.
“I am not religious,” he said. “But I will say ten Our [64] Fathers and ten Hail Marys
that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Cobre if I
catch him. That is a promise.”
He commenced to say his prayers mechanically. Sometimes he would be so tired that
he could not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would
come automatically. Hail Marys are easier to say than Our Fathers, he thought.
“Hail Mary full of Grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.” Then he added, “Blessed Virgin, pray for the
death of this fish. Wonderful though he is.”
With his prayers said, and feeling much better, but suffering exactly as much, and
perhaps a little more, he leaned against the wood of the bow and began, mechanically, to
work the fingers of his left hand.
The sun was hot now although the breeze was rising gently.
“I had better re-bait that little line out over the stern,” he said. “If the fish decides to
stay another night I will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottle. I don’t think
I can get anything but a dolphin [65] here. But if I eat him fresh enough he won’t be bad.
I wish a flying fish would come on board tonight. But I have no light to attract them. A
flying fish is excellent to eat raw and I would not have to cut him up. I must save all my
strength now. Christ, I did not know he was so big.”
“I’ll kill him though,” he said. “In all his greatness and his glory.”
Although it is unjust, he thought. But I will show him what a man can do and what a
man endures.
“I told the boy I was a strange old man,” he said.
“Now is when I must prove it.”
The thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing. Now he was proving it
again. Each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing
it.

I wish he’d sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought. Why are
the lions the main thing that is left? Don’t think, old man, he said to himself, Rest gently
now against the wood and think of nothing. He is working. Work as little as you can.
It was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily. But
there was an added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man [66] rode gently
with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and
smoothly.
Once in the afternoon the line started to rise again. But the fish only continued to
swim at a slightly higher level. The sun was on the old man’s left arm and shoulder and
on his back. So he knew the fish had turned east of north.
Now that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming in the water
with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the
dark. I wonder how much he sees at that depth, the old man thought. His eye is huge and
a horse, with much less eye, can see in the dark. Once I could see quite well in the dark.
Not in the absolute dark. But almost as a cat sees.
The sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now
completely and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of
his back to shift the hurt of the cord a little.
“If you’re not tired, fish,” he said aloud, “you must be very strange.”
He felt very tired now and he knew the night would come soon and he tried to think
of other things. He thought of the Big Leagues, to him they were the Gran [67] Ligas, and
he knew that the Yankees of New York were playing the Tigres of Detroit.
This is the second day now that I do not know the result of the juegos, he thought.
But I must have confidence and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all
things perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel. What is a bone spur? he
asked himself. Un espuela de hueso. We do not have them. Can it be as painful as the
spur of a fighting cock in one’s heel? I do not think I could endure that or the loss of the
eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks do. Man is not much
beside the great birds and beasts. Still I would rather be that beast down there in the
darkness of the sea.
“Unless sharks come,” he said aloud. “If sharks come, God pity him and me.”
Do you believe the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I will stay with
this one? he thought. I am sure he would and more since he is young and strong. Also his
father was a fisherman. But would the bone spur hurt him too much?
“I do not know,” he said aloud. “I never had a bone spur.”
As the sun set he remembered, to give himself more [68] confidence, the time in the
tavern at Casablanca when he had played the hand game with the great negro from
Cienfuegos who was the strongest man on the docks. They had gone one day and one
night with their elbows on a chalk line on the table and their forearms straight up and
their hands gripped tight. Each one was trying to force the other’s hand down onto the

table. There was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the
kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negro’s
face. They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees
could sleep. Blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negro’s hands
and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors
went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched. The
walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows
against them. The negro’s shadow was huge and it moved on the wall as the breeze
moved the lamps.
The odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and
lighted cigarettes for him.
Then the negro, after the rum, would try for a tremendous [69] effort and once he
had the old man, who was not an old man then but was Santiago El Campeon, nearly
three inches off balance. But the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again. He
was sure then that he had the negro, who was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten. And
at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be called a draw and the referee was
shaking his head, he had unleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and
down until it rested on the wood. The match had started on a Sunday morning and ended
on a Monday morning. Many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they had to go
to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the Havana Coal Company. Otherwise
everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish. But he had finished it anyway and before
anyone had to go to work.
For a long time after that everyone had called him The Champion and there had
been a return match in the spring. But not much money was bet and he had won it quite
easily since he had broken the confidence of the negro from Cienfuegos in the first match.
After that he had a few matches and then no more. He decided that he could beat anyone
if he wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was bad for his right [70] hand for
fishing. He had tried a few practice matches with his left hand. But his left hand had
always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it to do and he did not trust it.
The sun will bake it out well now, he thought. It should not cramp on me again
unless it gets too cold in the night. I wonder what this night will bring.
An airplane passed overhead on its course to Miami and he watched its shadow
scaring up the schools of flying fish.
“With so much flying fish there should be dolphin,” he said, and leaned back on the
line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish. But he could not and it stayed at the
hardness and water-drop shivering that preceded breaking. The boat moved ahead slowly
and he watched the airplane until he could no longer see it.
It must be very strange in an airplane, he thought. I wonder what the sea looks like
from that height? They should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high. I
would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above. In
the turtle boats I was in the cross-trees of the mast-head and even at that height I saw
much. The dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripes and their purple

[71] spots and you can see all of the school as they swim. Why is it that all the fast-moving
fish of the dark current have purple backs and usually purple stripes or spots? The
dolphin looks green of course because he is really golden. But when he comes to feed,
truly hungry, purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin. Can it be anger, or the
greater speed he makes that brings them out?
Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved
and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a
yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in
the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. It
jumped again and again in the acrobatics of its fear and he worked his way back to the
stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and arm, he pulled the
dolphin in with his left hand, stepping on the gained line each time with his bare left foot.
When the fish was at the stem, plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation, the
old man leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish with its purple spots over
the stem. Its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites against [72] the hook and it
pounded the bottom of the skiff with its long flat body, its tail and its head until he
clubbed it across the shining golden head until it shivered and was still.
The old man unhooked the fish, re-baited the line with another sardine and tossed it
over. Then he worked his way slowly back to the bow. He washed his left hand and wiped
it on his trousers. Then he shifted the heavy line from his right hand to his left and
washed his right hand in the sea while he watched the sun go into the ocean and the slant
of the big cord.
“He hasn’t changed at all,” he said. But watching the movement of the water against
his hand he noted that it was perceptibly slower.
“I’ll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night,”
he said. “He’s good for the night and so am I.”
It would be better to gut the dolphin a little later to save the blood in the meat, he
thought. I can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time. I
had better keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset. The setting of
the sun is a difficult time for all fish. He let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line
[73] with it and eased himself as much as he could and allowed himself to be pulled
forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as much, or more, than he did.
I’m learning how to do it, he thought. This part of it anyway. Then too, remember he
hasn’t eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food. I have eaten the
whole bonito. Tomorrow I will eat the dolphin. He called it dorado. Perhaps I should eat
some of it when I clean it. It will be harder to eat than the bonito. But, then, nothing is
easy.
“How do you feel, fish?” he asked aloud. “I feel good and my left hand is better and I
have food for a night and a day. Pull the boat, fish.”
He did not truly feel good because the pain from the cord across his back had almost
passed pain and gone into a dullness that he mistrusted. But I have had worse things
than that, he thought. My hand is only cut a little and the cramp is gone from the other.

My legs are all right. Also now I have gained on him in the question of sustenance.
It was dark now as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in September. He lay
against the worn wood of the bow and rested all that he could. The first stars [74] were
out. He did not know the name of Rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out
and he would have all his distant friends.
“The fish is my friend too,” he said aloud. “I have never seen or heard of such a fish.
But I must kill him. I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars.”
Imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought. The moon runs
away. But imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun? We were born
lucky, he thought.
Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to
kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. How many people will he feed, he thought.
But are they worthy to eat him? No, of course not. There is no one worthy of eating him
from the manner of his behaviour and his great dignity.
I do not understand these things, he thought. But it is good that we do not have to
try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars. It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true
brothers.
Now, he thought, I must think about the drag. It has its perils and its merits. I may
lose so much line that I will lose him, if he makes his effort and the drag [75] made by the
oars is in place and the boat loses all her lightness. Her lightness prolongs both our
suffering but it is my safety since he has great speed that he has never yet employed. No
matter what passes I must gut the dolphin so he does not spoil and eat some of him to be
strong.
Now I will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady before I move back
to the stern to do the work and make the decision. In the meantime I can see how he acts
and if he shows any changes. The oars are a good trick; but it has reached the time to play
for safety. He is much fish still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth
and he has kept his mouth tight shut. The punishment of the hook is nothing. The
punishment of hunger, and that he is against something that he does not comprehend, is
everything. Rest now, old man, and let him work until your next duty comes.
He rested for what he believed to be two hours. The moon did not rise now until late
and he had no way of judging the time. Nor was he really resting except comparatively.
He was still bearing the pull of the fish across his shoulders but he placed his left hand on
the [76] gunwale of the bow and confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to
the skiff itself.
How simple it would be if I could make the line fast, he thought. But with one small
lurch he could break it. I must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all times
be ready to give line with both hands.
“But you have not slept yet, old man,” he said aloud. “It is half a day and a night and
now another day and you have not slept. You must devise a way so that you sleep a little if

he is quiet and steady. If you do not sleep you might become unclear in the head.”
I’m clear enough in the head, he thought. Too clear. I am as clear as the stars that are
my brothers. Still I must sleep. They sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the
ocean sleeps sometimes on certain days when there is no current and a flat calm.
But remember to sleep, he thought. Make yourself do it and devise some simple and
sure way about the lines. Now go back and prepare the dolphin. It is too dangerous to rig
the oars as a drag if you must sleep.
I could go without sleeping, he told himself. But it would be too dangerous.
[77] He started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees, being
careful not to jerk against the fish. He may be half asleep himself, he thought. But I do
not want him to rest. He must pull until he dies.
Back in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of the line across his
shoulders and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand. The stars were bright
now and he saw the dolphin clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head
and drew him out from under the stern. He put one of his feet on the fish and slit him
quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower jaw. Then he put his knife down and
gutted him with his right hand, scooping him clean and pulling the gills clear.
He felt the maw heavy and slippery in his hands and he slit it open. There were two
flying fish inside. They were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped
the guts and the gills over the stern. They sank leaving a trail of phosphorescence in the
water. The dolphin was cold and a leprous gray-white now in the starlight and the old
man skinned one side of him while he held his right foot on the fish’s head. Then he
turned him over and skinned the other side and cut each side off from the head down to
the tail.
[78] He slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the
water. But there was only the light of its slow descent. He turned then and placed the two
flying fish inside the two fillets of fish and putting his knife back in its sheath, he worked
his way slowly back to the bow. His back was bent with the weight of the line across it and
he carried the fish in his right hand.
Back in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish
beside them. After that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it
again with his left hand resting on the gunwale. Then he leaned over the side and washed
the flying fish in the water, noting the speed of the water against his hand. His hand was
phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he watched the flow of the water against it.
The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking of the
skiff, particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern.
“He is tiring or he is resting,” the old man said. “Now let me get through the eating of
this dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep.”
Under the stars and with the night colder all the [79] time he ate half of one of the
dolphin fillets and one of the flying fish, gutted and with its head cut off.

“What an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked,” he said. “And what a miserable fish
raw. I will never go in a boat again without salt or limes.”
If I had brains I would have splashed water on the bow all day and drying, it would
have made salt, he thought. But then I did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset. Still
it was a lack of preparation. But I have chewed it all well and I am not nauseated.
The sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were
gone. It looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and the wind
had dropped.
“There will be bad weather in three or four days,” he said. “But not tonight and not
tomorrow. Rig now to get some sleep, old man, while the fish is calm and steady.”
He held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh against his right
hand as he leaned all his weight against the wood of the bow. Then he passed the line a
little lower on his shoulders and braced his left hand on it.
My right hand can hold it as long as it is braced, he [80] thought If it relaxes in sleep
my left hand will wake me as the line goes out. It is hard on the right hand. But he is used
to punishment Even if I sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good. He lay forward
cramping himself against the line with all of his body, putting all his weight onto his right
band, and he was asleep.
He did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises that stretched
for eight or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating and they would leap high into
the air and return into the same hole they had made in the water when they leaped.
Then he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther and
he was very cold and his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of
a pillow.
After that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the
lions come down onto it in the early dark and then the other lions came and he rested his
chin on the wood of the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore
breeze and he waited to see if there would be more lions and he was happy.
The moon had been up for a long time but he slept [81] on and the fish pulled on
steadily and the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds.
He woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning
out through his right hand. He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could
with his right and the line rushed out. Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned
back against the line and now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left hand was
taking all the strain and cutting badly. He looked back at the coils of line and they were
feeding smoothly. Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean and
then a heavy fall. Then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although
line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to breaking point and
raising it to breaking point again and again. He had been pulled down tight onto the bow
and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move.

This is what we waited for, he thought. So now let us take it. Make him pay for the
line, he thought. Make him pay for it.
He could not see the fish’s jumps but only heard the [82] breaking of the ocean and
the heavy splash as he fell. The speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had
always known this would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused
parts and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the fingers.
If the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought. Yes. If the boy were
here. If the boy were here.
The line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish
earn each inch of it. Now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish
that his cheek had crushed. Then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet.
He was ceding line but more slowly all he time. He worked back to where he could feel
with his foot the coils of line that he could not see. There was plenty of line still and now
the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water.
Yes, he thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the
sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring
him up. He will start circling soon and then I must work on him. I wonder what started
him so suddenly? Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, [83] or was he
frightened by something in the night? Maybe he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a
calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident. It is strange.
“You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,” he said. “You’re holding
him again but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle.”
The old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and stooped down
and scooped up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face. He
was afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength. When
his face was cleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side and then let it
stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise. He’s
headed almost east, he thought. That means he is tired and going with the current. Soon
he will have to circle. Then our true work begins.
After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out
and looked at it.
“It is not bad,” he said. “And pain does not matter to a man.”
He took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts
and shifted his weight [84] so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other
side of the skiff.
“You did not do so badly for something worthless,” he said to his left hand. “But
there was a moment when I could not find you.”
Why was I not born with two good hands? he thought. Perhaps it was my fault in not
training that one properly. But God knows he has had enough chances to learn. He did
not do so badly in the night, though, and he has only cramped once. If he cramps again

let the line cut him off.
When he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and he thought he
should chew some more of the dolphin. But I can’t, he told himself. It is better to be
light-headed than to lose your strength from nausea. And I know I cannot keep it if I eat
it since my face was in it. I will keep it for an emergency until it goes bad. But it is too late
to try for strength now through nourishment. You’re stupid, he told himself. Eat the other
flying fish.
It was there, cleaned and ready, and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it
chewing the bones carefully and eating all of it down to the tail.
It has more nourishment than almost any fish, he [85] thought. At least the kind of
strength that I need. Now I have done what I can, he thought. Let him begin to circle and
let the fight come.
The sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to
circle.
He could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling. It was too early for
that. He just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull
on it gently with his right hand. It tightened, as always, but just when he reached the
point where it would break, line began to come in. He slipped his shoulders and head
from under the line and began to pull in line steadily and gently. He used both of his
hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as much as he could with his body
and his legs. His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of the pulling.
“It is a very big circle,” he said. “But he is circling.” Then the line would not come in
any more and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun. Then it started
out and the old man knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water.
“He is making the far part of his circle now,” he said. I must hold all I can, he
thought. The strain will [86] shorten his circle each time. Perhaps in an hour I will see
him. Now I must convince him and then I must kill him.
But the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired
deep into his bones two hours later. But the circles were much shorter now and from the
way the line slanted he could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam.
For an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat
salted his eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead. He was not afraid of
the black spots. They were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line. Twice,
though, he had felt faint and dizzy and that had worried him.
“I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this,” he said. “Now that I have him
coming so beautifully, God help me endure. I’ll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred
Hail Marys. But I cannot say them now.
Consider them said, he thought. I’ll say them later. Just then he felt a sudden
banging and jerking on the line he held with his two hands. It was sharp and hard-feeling
and heavy.

He is hitting the wire leader with his spear, he [87] thought. That was bound to come.
He had to do that. It may make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling
now. The jumps were necessary for him to take air. But after that each one can widen the
opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook.
“Don’t jump, fish,” he said. “Don’t jump.”
The fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the old
man gave up a little line.
I must hold his pain where it is, he thought. Mine does not matter. I can control
mine. But his pain could drive him mad.
After a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again.
The old man was gaining line steadily now. But he felt faint again. He lifted some sea
water with his left hand and put it on his head. Then he put more on and rubbed the back
of his neck.
“I have no cramps,” he said. “He’ll be up soon and I can last. You have to last. Don’t
even speak of it.”
He kneeled against the bow and, for a moment, slipped the line over his back again.
I’ll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he
comes in, he decided.
[88] It was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by
himself without recovering any line. But when the strain showed the fish had turned to
come toward the boat, the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the
weaving pulling that brought in all the line he gained.
I’m tireder than I have ever been, he thought, and now the trade wind is rising. But
that will be good to take him in with. I need that badly.
“I’ll rest on the next turn as he goes out,” he said. “I feel much better. Then in two or
three turns more I will have him.”
His straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the bow with the
pull of the line as he felt the fish turn.
You work now, fish, he thought. I’ll take you at the turn.
The sea had risen considerably. But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it
to get home.
“I’ll just steer south and west,” he said. “A man is never lost at sea and it is a long
island.”
It was on the third turn that he saw the fish first.
He saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long [89] to pass under the boat that
he could not believe its length.

“No,” he said. “He can’t be that big.”
But he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty
yards away and the man saw his tail out of water. It was higher than a big scythe blade
and a very pale lavender above the dark blue water. It raked back and as the fish swam
just below the surface the old man could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that
banded him. His dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals were spread wide.
On this circle the old man could see the fish’s eye and the two gray sucking fish that
swain around him. Sometimes they attached themselves to him. Sometimes they darted
off. Sometimes they would swim easily in his shadow. They were each over three feet long
and when they swam fast they lashed their whole bodies like eels.
The old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun. On each
calm placid turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in two turns
more he would have a chance to get the harpoon in.
[90] But I must get him close, close, close, he thought. I mustn’t try for the head. I
must get the heart.
“Be calm and strong, old man,” he said.
On the next circle the fish’s beck was out but he was a little too far from the boat. On
the next circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the old man
was sure that by gaining some more line he could have him alongside.
He had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in a round basket
and the end was made fast to the bitt in the bow.
The fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his
great tail moving. The old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer. For
just a moment the fish turned a little on his side. Then he straightened himself and began
another circle.
“I moved him,” the old man said. “I moved him then.”
He felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could. I
moved him, he thought. Maybe this time I can get him over. Pull, hands, he thought.
Hold up, legs. Last for me, head. Last for me. You never went. This time I’ll pull him over.
[91] But when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the fish came
alongside and pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled part way over and then righted
himself and swam away.
“Fish,” the old man said. “Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to
kill me too?”
That way nothing is accomplished, he thought. His mouth was too dry to speak but
he could not reach for the water now. I must get him alongside this time, he thought. I
am not good for many more turns. Yes you are, he told himself. You’re good for ever.

On the next turn, he nearly had him. But again the fish righted himself and swam
slowly away.
You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I
seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother.
Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who.
Now you are getting confused in the head, he thought. You must keep your head
clear. Keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man. Or a fish, he thought.
“Clear up, head,” he said in a voice he could hardly hear. “Clear up.”
[92] Twice more it was the same on the turns. I do not know, the old man thought.
He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time. I do not know. But I will try it
once more. He tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish. The
fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air. I’ll
try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could
only see well in flashes. He tried it again and it was the same. So he thought, and he felt
himself going before he started; I will try it once again.
He took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he
put it against the fish’s agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his
side, his bill almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat, long,
deep, wide, silver and barred with purple and interminable in the water.
The old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as
he could and drove it down with all his strength, and more strength he had [93] just
summoned, into the fish’s side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to
the altitude of the man’s chest. He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it
further and then pushed all his weight after it.
Then the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water
showing all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty. He seemed to
hang in the air above the old man in the skiff. Then he fell into the water with a crash that
sent spray over the old man and over all of the skiff.
The old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well. But he cleared the harpoon
line and let it run slowly through his raw hands and, when he could see, he saw the fish
was on his back with his silver belly up. The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an
angle from the fish’s shoulder and the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from
his heart. First it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that was more than a mile deep.
Then it spread like a cloud. The fish was silvery and still and floated with the waves.
The old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had. Then he took two
turns of the harpoon [94] line around the bitt in the bow and hid his head on his hands.
“Keep my head dear,” he said against the wood of the bow. “I am a tired old man. But
I have killed this fish which is my brother and now I must do the slave work.”
Now I must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside, he thought. Even
if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out, this skiff would never

hold him. I must prepare everything, then bring him in and lash him well and step the
mast and set sail for home.
He started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line
through his gills and out his mouth and make his head fast alongside the bow. I want to
see him, he thought, and to touch and to feel him. He is my fortune, he thought. But that
is not why I wish to feel him. I think I felt his heart, he thought. When I pushed on the
harpoon shaft the second time. Bring him in now and make him fast and get the noose
around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to the skiff.
“Get to work, old man,” he said. He took a very [95] small drink of the water. “There
is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is over.”
He looked up at the sky and then out to his fish. He looked at the sun carefully. It is
not much more than noon, he thought. And the trade wind is rising. The lines all mean
nothing now. The boy and I will splice them when we are home.
“Come on, fish,” he said. But the fish did not come.
Instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff upon
to him.
When he was even with him and had the fish’s head against the bow he could not
believe his size. But he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt, passed it through the fish’s
gills and out his jaws, made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the
other gill, made another turn around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it
fast to the bitt in the bow. He cut the rope then and went astern to noose the tail. The fish
had turned silver from his original purple and silver, and the stripes showed the same
pale violet colour as his tail. They were wider than a man’s hand with his fingers spread
and the fish’s eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a saint in a
procession.
[96] “It was the only way to kill him,” the old man said. He was feeling better since
the water and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear. He’s over fifteen
hundred pounds the way he is, he thought. Maybe much more. If he dresses out
two-thirds of that at thirty cents a pound?
“I need a pencil for that,” he said. “My head is not that clear. But I think the great
DiMaggio would be proud of me today. I had no bone spurs. But the hands and the back
hurt truly.” I wonder what a bone spur is, he thought. Maybe we have them without
knowing of it.
He made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart. He was so big it
was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside. He cut a piece of line and tied the fish’s
lower jaw against his bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as
possible. Then he stepped the mast and, with the stick that was his gaff and with his
boom rigged, the patched sail drew, the boat began to move, and half lying in the stern he
sailed south-west.
He did not need a compass to tell him where southwest was. He only needed the feel

of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail. I better put a small line [97] out with a
spoon on it and try and get something to eat and drink for the moisture. But he could not
find a spoon and his sardines were rotten. So he hooked a patch of yellow Gulf weed with
the gaff as they passed and shook it so that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the
planking of the skiff. There were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked
like sand fleas. The old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and forefinger and
ate them chewing up the shells and the tails. They were very tiny but he knew they were
nourishing and they tasted good.
The old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after
he had eaten the shrimps. The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he
steered with the tiller under his arm. He could see the fish and he had only to look at his
hands and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was
not a dream. At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, he had thought
perhaps it was a dream. Then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and hang
motionless in the sky before he fell, he was sure there was some great strangeness and he
could not believe it.
[98] Then he could not see well, although now he saw as well as ever. Now he knew
there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream. The hands cure quickly, he
thought. I bled them clean and the salt water will heal them. The dark water of the true
gulf is the greatest healer that there is. All I must do is keep the head clear. The hands
have done their work and we sail well. With his mouth shut and his tail straight up and
down we sail like brothers. Then his head started to become a little unclear and he
thought, is he bringing me in or am I bringing him in? If I were towing him behind there
would be no question. Nor if the fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone, there would
be no question either. But they were sailing together lashed side by side and the old man
thought, let him bring me in if it pleases him. I am only better than him through trickery
and he meant me no harm.
They sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep
his head clear. There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the
old man knew the breeze would last all night. The old man looked at the fish constantly
[99] to make sure it was true. It was an hour before the first shark hit him.
The shark was not an accident. He had come up from deep down in the water as the
dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea. He had come up so
fast and absolutely without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in
the sun. Then he fell back into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on
the course the skiff and the fish had taken.
Sometimes he lost the scent. But he would pick it up again, or have just a trace of it,
and he swam fast and hard on the course. He was a very big Make shark built to swim as
fast as the fastest fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws.
His back was as blue as a sword fish’s and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth
and handsome. He was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight
shut now as he swam fast, just under the surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through
the water without wavering. Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of
teeth were slanted inwards. They were not the ordinary pyramid-shaped teeth of most

sharks. They were shaped like a man’s [100] fingers when they are crisped like claws.
They were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man and they had razor-sharp cutting
edges on both sides. This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea, that were so
fast and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy. Now he speeded up as he
smelled the fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water.
When the old man saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had no fear at
all and would do exactly what he wished. He prepared the harpoon and made the rope
fast while he watched the shark come on. The rope was short as it lacked what he had cut
away to lash the fish.
The old man’s head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had
little hope. It was too good to last, he thought. He took one look at the great fish as he
watched the shark close in. It might as well have been a dream, he thought. I cannot keep
him from hitting me but maybe I can get him. Dentuso, he thought. Bad luck to your
mother.
The shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth
open and his strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the
meat just above the tail. The shark’s head [101] was out of water and his back was coming
out and the old man could hear the noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he
rammed the harpoon down onto the shark’s head at a spot where the line between his
eyes intersected with the line that ran straight back from his nose. There were no such
lines. There was only the heavy sharp blue head and the big eyes and the clicking,
thrusting all-swallowing jaws. But that was the location of the brain and the old man hit
it. He hit it with his blood mushed hands driving a good harpoon with all his strength. He
hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy.
The shark swung over and the old man saw his eye was not alive and then he swung
over once again, wrapping himself in two loops of the rope. The old man knew that he
was dead but the shark would not accept it. Then, on his back, with his tail lashing and
his jaws clicking, the shark plowed over the water as a speedboat does. The water was
white where his tail beat it and three-quarters of his body was clear above the water when
the rope came taut, shivered, and then snapped. The shark lay quietly for a little while on
the surface and the old man watched him. Then he went down very slowly.
[102] “He took about forty pounds,” the old man said aloud. He took my harpoon too
and all the rope, he thought, and now my fish bleeds again and there will be others. He
did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been mutilated. When the fish had
been hit it was as though he himself were hit. But I killed the shark that hit my fish, he
thought. And he was the biggest dentuso that I have ever seen. And God knows that I
have seen big ones. It was too good to last, he thought. I wish it had been a dream now
and that I had never hooked the fish and was alone in bed on the newspapers.
“But man is not made for defeat,” he said. “A man can be destroyed but not
defeated.” I am sorry that I killed the fish though, he thought. Now the bad time is
coming and I do not even have the harpoon. The dentuso is cruel and able and strong and
intelligent. But I was more intelligent than he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I
was only better armed.

“Don’t think, old man,” he said aloud. “Sail on this course and take it when it comes.
But I must think, he thought. Because it is all I have left. That and baseball. I wonder
how the great [103] DiMaggio would have liked the way I hit him in the brain? It was no
great thing, he thought. Any man could do it. But do you think my hands were as great a
handicap as the bone spurs? I cannot know. I never had anything wrong with my heel
except the time the sting ray stung it when I stepped on him when swimming and
paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain.
“Think about something cheerful, old man,” he said. “Every minute now you are
closer to home. You sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds.”
He knew quite well the pattern of what could happen when he reached the inner part
of the current. But there was nothing to be done now.
“Yes there is,” he said aloud. “I can lash my knife to the butt of one of the oars.”
So he did that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the sail under his foot.
“Now,” he said. “I am still an old man. But I am not unarmed.”
The breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well. He watched only the forward part of
the fish and some of his hope returned.
It is silly not to hope, he thought. Besides I believe [104] it is a sin. Do not think
about sin, he thought. There are enough problems now without sin. Also I have no
understanding of it.
I have no understanding of it and I am not sure that I believe in it. Perhaps it was a
sin to kill the fish. I suppose it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many
people. But then everything is a sin. Do not think about sin. It is much too late for that
and there are people who are paid to do it. Let them think about it. You were born to be a
fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish. San Pedro was a fisherman as was the father
of the great DiMaggio.
But he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and since there was
nothing to read and he did not have a radio, he thought much and he kept on thinking
about sin. You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he thought. You
killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive
and you loved him after. If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?
“You think too much, old man,” he said aloud.
But you enjoyed killing the dentuso, he thought. He lives on the live fish as you do.
He is not a scavenger [105] nor just a moving appetite as some sharks are. He is beautiful
and noble and knows no fear of anything.
“I killed him in self-defense,” the old man said aloud. “And I killed him well.”
Besides, he thought, everything kills everything else in some way. Fishing kills me
exactly as it keeps me alive. The boy keeps me alive, he thought. I must not deceive

myself too much.
He leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the
shark had cut him. He chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste. It was firm and
juicy, like meat, but it was not red. There was no stringiness in it and he knew that it
would bring the highest price In the market. But there was no way to keep its scent out of
the water and the old man knew that a very had time was coming.
The breeze was steady. It had backed a little further into the north-east and he knew
that meant that it would not fall off. The old man looked ahead of him but he could see no
sails nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of any ship. There were only the flying fish
that went up from his bow sailing away to either side and the yellow patches of Gulf weed.
He could not even see a bird.
[106] He had sailed for two hours, resting in the stern and sometimes chewing a bit
of the meat from the marlin, trying to rest and to be strong, when he saw the first of the
two sharks. “Ay,” he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is
just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his
hands and into the wood.
“Galanos,” he said aloud. He had seen the second fin now coming up behind the first
and had identified them as shovel-nosed sharks by the brown, triangular fin and the
sweeping movements of the tail. They had the scent and were excited and in the stupidity
of their great hunger they were losing and finding the scent in their excitement. But they
were closing all the time.
The old man made the sheet fast and jammed the tiller. Then he took up the oar with
the knife lashed to it. He lifted it as lightly as he could because his hands rebelled at the
pain. Then he opened and closed them on it lightly to loosen them. He closed them firmly
so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watched the sharks come. He
could see their wide, flattened, shovel-pointed heads now and their white tipped wide
pectoral fins. They were hateful sharks, [107] bad smelling, scavengers as well as killers,
and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat. It was these
sharks that would cut the turtles’ legs and flippers off when the turtles were asleep on the
surface, and they would hit a man in the water, if they were hungry, even if the man had
no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him.
“Ay,” the old man said. “Galanos. Come on galanos.”
They came. But they did not come as the Mako had come. One turned and went out
of sight under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff shake as he jerked and pulled
on the fish. The other watched the old man with his slitted yellow eyes and then came in
fast with his half circle of jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten. The
line showed clearly on the top of his brown head and back where the brain joined the
spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the oar into the juncture, withdrew it, and
drove it in again into the shark’s yellow cat-like eyes. The shark let go of the fish and slid
down, swallowing what he had taken as he died.
The skiff was still shaking with the destruction the other shark was doing to the fish
and the old man let [108] go the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadside and bring

the shark out from under. When he saw the shark he leaned over the side and punched at
him. He hit only meat and the hide was set hard and he barely got the knife in. The blow
hurt not only his hands but his shoulder too. But the shark came up fast with his head out
and the old man hit him squarely in the center of his flat-topped head as his nose came
out of water and lay against the fish. The old man withdrew the blade and punched the
shark exactly in the same spot again. He still hung to the fish with his jaws hooked and
the old man stabbed him in his left eye. The shark still hung there.
“No?” the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and the brain.
It was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever. The old man reversed the oar and
put the blade between the shark’s jaws to open them. He twisted the blade and as the
shark slid loose he said, “Go on, galano. Slide down a mile deep. Go see your friend, or
maybe it’s your mother.”
The old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar. Then he found the
sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course.
[109] “They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat,” he said aloud. “I
wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I’m sorry about it, fish. It makes
everything wrong.” He stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now. Drained of
blood and awash he looked the colour of the silver backing of a minor and his stripes still
showed.
“I shouldn’t have gone out so far, fish,” he said. “Neither for you nor for me. I’m
sorry, fish.”
Now, he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut.
Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.
“I wish I had a stone for the knife,” the old man said after he had checked the lashing
on the oar butt. “I should have brought a stone.” You should have brought many things,
he thought. But you did not bring them, old man. Now is no time to think of what you do
not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.
“You give me much good counsel,” he said aloud. “I’m tired of it.” He held the tiller
under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove forward. “God
knows how much that last one took,” he said.
[110] “But she’s much lighter now.” He did not want to think of the mutilated
under-side of the fish. He knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been
meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway
through the sea.
He was a fish to keep a man all winter, he thought Don’t think of that. Just rest and
try to get your hands in shape to defend what is left of him. The blood smell from my
hands means nothing now with all that scent in the water. Besides they do not bleed
much. There is nothing cut that means anything. The bleeding may keep the left from
cramping.
What can I think of now? he thought. Nothing. I must think of nothing and wait for

the next ones. I wish it had really been a dream, he thought. But who knows? It might
have turned out well.
The next shark that came was a single shovelnose. He came like a pig to the trough if
a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it. The old man let him hit the
fish and then drove the knife on the oar don into his brain. But the shark jerked
backwards as he rolled and the knife blade snapped.
The old man settled himself to steer. He did not even watch the big shark sinking
slowly in the water, [111] showing first life-size, then small, then tiny. That always
fascinated the old man. But he did not even watch it now.
“I have the gaff now,” he said. “But it will do no good. I have the two oars and the
tiller and the short club.”
Now they have beaten me, he thought. I am too old to club sharks to death. But I will
try it as long as I have the oars and the short club and the tiller.
He put his hands in the water again to soak them. It was getting late in the afternoon
and he saw nothing but the sea and the sky. There was more wind in the sky than there
had been, and soon he hoped that he would see land.
“You’re tired, old man,” he said. “You’re tired inside.”
The sharks did not hit him again until just before sunset.
The old man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in
the water.
They were not even quartering on the scent. They were headed straight for the skiff
swimming side by side. He jammed the tiller, made the sheet fast and reached under the
stem for the club. It was an oar handle [112] from a broken oar sawed off to about two
and a half feet in length. He could only use it
effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold of
it with his right hand, flexing his hand on it, as he watched the sharks come. They were
both galanos.
I must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or
straight across the top of the head, he thought.
The two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and
sink them into the silver side of the fish, he raised the club high and brought it down
heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark’s broad head. He felt the rubbery solidity
as the club came down. But he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once
more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish.
The other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide. The
old man could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws
as he bumped the fish and closed his jaws. He swung at him and hit only the head and the
shark looked at him and wrenched the meat loose. The [113] old man swung the club

down on him again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid
rubberiness.
“Come on, galano,” the old man said. “Come in again.”
The shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws. He hit him
solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club. This time he felt the bone at the
base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat
loose sluggishly and slid down from the fish.
The old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed. Then he saw
one on the surface swimming in circles. He did not see the fin of the other.
I could not expect to kill them, he thought. I could have in my time. But I have hurt
them both badly and neither one can feel very good. If I could have used a bat with two
hands I could have killed the first one surely. Even now, he thought.
He did not want to look at the fish. He knew that half of him had been destroyed.
The sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks.
“It will be dark soon,” he said. “Then I should see [114] the glow of Havana.. If I am
too far to the eastward I will see the lights of one of the new beaches.”
I cannot be too far out now, he thought. I hope no one has been too worried. There is
only the boy to worry, of course. But I am sure he would have confidence. Many of the
older fishermen will worry. Many others too, he thought. I live in a good town.
He could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly.
Then something came into his head.
“Half fish,” he said. “Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too far out. I ruined
us both. But we have killed many sharks, you and I, and ruined many others. How many
did you ever kill, old fish? You do not have that spear on your head for nothing.”
He liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swimming
free. I should have chopped the bill off to fight them with, he thought. But there was no
hatchet and then there was no knife.
But if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon. Then we might
have fought them together. What will you do now if they come in the night? What can you
do?
“Fight them,” he said. “I’ll fight them until I die.”
[115] But in the dark now and no glow showing and no lights and only the wind and
the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was already dead. He put his two hands
together and felt the palms. They were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by
simply opening and closing them. He leaned his back against the stern and knew he was
not dead. His shoulders told him.
I have all those prayers I promised if I caught the fish, he thought. But I am too tired

to say them now. I better get the sack and put it over my shoulders.
He lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky. I have
half of him, he thought. Maybe I’ll have the luck to bring the forward half in. I should
have some luck. No, he said. You violated your luck when you went too far outside.
“Don’t be silly,” he said aloud. “And keep awake and steer. You may have much luck
yet.”
“I’d like to buy some if there’s any place they sell it,” he said.
What could I buy it with? he asked himself. Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a
broken knife and two bad hands?
“You might,” he said. “You tried to buy it with [116] eighty-four days at sea. They
nearly sold it to you too.”
I must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and
who can recognize her? I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked. I
wish I could see the glow from the lights, he thought. I wish too many things. But that is
the thing I wish for now. He tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain he
knew he was not dead.
He saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten
o’clock at night. They were only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the
moon rises. Then they were steady to see across the ocean which was rough now with the
increasing breeze. He steered inside of the glow and he thought that now, soon, he must
hit the edge of the stream.
Now it is over, he thought. They will probably hit me again. But what can a man do
against them in the dark without a weapon?
He was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body
hurt with the cold of the night. I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought. I hope so
much I do not have to fight again.
[117] But by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless. They
came in a pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their
phosphorescence as they threw themselves on the fish. He clubbed at heads and heard
the jaws chop and the shaking of the skiff as they took hold below. He clubbed
desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it
was gone.
He jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it, holding it in
both hands and driving it down again and again. But they were up to the bow now and
driving in one after the other and together, tearing off the pieces of meat that showed
glowing below the sea as they turned to come once more.
One came, finally, against the head itself and he knew that it was over. He swung the
tiller across the shark’s head where the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fish’s
head which would not tear. He swung it once and twice and again. He heard the tiller

break and he lunged at the shark with the splintered butt. He felt it go in and knowing it
was sharp he drove it in again. The shark let go and rolled away. That was the [118] last
shark of the pack that came. There was nothing more for them to eat.
The old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth. It
was coppery and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment. But there was not much of
it.
He spat into the ocean and said, “Eat that, galanos. And make a dream you’ve killed
a man.”
He knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back to the
stern and found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough
for him to steer. He settled the sack around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course.
He sailed lightly now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind. He was past
everything now and he sailed the skiff to make his home port as well and as intelligently
as he could. In the night sharks hit the carcass as someone might pick up crumbs from
the table. The old man paid no attention to them and did not pay any attention to
anything except steering. He only noticed how lightly and bow well the skiff sailed now
there was no great weight beside her.
[119] She’s good, he thought. She is sound and not harmed in any way except for the
tiller. That is easily replaced. He could feel he was inside the current now and he could
see the lights of the beach colonies along the shore. He knew where he was now and it
was nothing to get home.
The wind is our friend, anyway, he thought. Then he added, sometimes. And the
great sea with our friends and our enemies. And bed, he thought. Bed is my friend. Just
bed, he thought. Bed will be a great thing. It is easy when you are beaten, he thought. I
never knew how easy it was. And what beat you, he thought.
“Nothing,” he said aloud. “I went out too far.”
When he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the Terrace were out and he knew
everyone was in bed. The breeze had risen steadily and was blowing strongly now. It was
quiet in the harbour though and he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the
rocks. There was no one to help him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could. Then he
stepped out and made her fast to a rock.
[120] He unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it. Then he shouldered the
mast and started to climb. It was then he knew the depth of his tiredness. He stopped for
a moment and looked back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of
the fish standing up well behind the skiff’s stern. He saw the white naked line of his
backbone and the dark mass of the head with the projecting bill and all the nakedness
between.
He started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast
across his shoulder. He tried to get up. But it was too difficult and he sat there with the
mast on his shoulder and looked at the road. A cat passed on the far side going about its
business and the old man watched it. Then he just watched the road.

Finally he put the mast down and stood up. He picked the mast up and put it on his
shoulder and started up the road. He had to sit down five times before he reached his
shack.
Inside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall. In the dark he found a water
bottle and took a drink. Then he lay down on the bed. He pulled the blanket [121] over his
shoulders and then over his back and legs and he slept face down on the newspapers with
his arms out straight and the palms of his hands up.
He was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning. It was blowing so
hard that the drifting-boats would not be going out and the boy had slept late and then
come to the old man’s shack as he had come each morning. The boy saw that the old man
was breathing and then he saw the old man’s hands and he started to cry. He went out
very quietly to go to bring some coffee and all the way down the road he was crying.
Many fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside it and one
was in the water, his trousers rolled up, measuring the skeleton with a length of line.
The boy did not go down. He had been there before and one of the fishermen was
looking after the skiff for him. “How is he?” one of the fishermen shouted. “Sleeping,” the
boy called. He did not care that they saw him crying. “Let no one disturb him.” “He was
eighteen feet from nose to tail,” the fisherman who was measuring him called.
[122] “I believe it,” the boy said.
He went into the Terrace and asked for a can of coffee.
“Hot and with plenty of milk and sugar in it.”
“Anything more?”
“No. Afterwards I will see what he can eat.”
“What a fish it was,” the proprietor said. “There has never been such a fish. Those
were two fine fish you took yesterday too.” “Damn my fish,” the boy said and he started to
cry again.
“Do you want a drink of any kind?” the proprietor asked.
“No,” the boy said. “Tell them not to bother Santiago. I’ll be back.”
“Tell him how sorry I am.”
“Thanks,” the boy said.
The boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man’s shack and sat by him until
he woke. Once it looked as though he were waking. But he had gone back into heavy sleep
and the boy had gone across the road to borrow some wood to heat the coffee.
Finally the old man woke.
[123] “Don’t sit up,” the boy said. “Drink this.”

He poured some of the coffee in a glass.
The old man took it and drank it.
“They beat me, Manolin,” he said. “They truly beat me.”
“He didn’t beat you. Not the fish.”
“No. Truly. It was afterwards.”
“Pedrico is looking after the skiff and the gear. What do you want done with the
head?”
“Let Pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps.”
“And the spear?”
“You keep it if you want it.”
“I want it,” the boy said. “Now we must make our plans about the other things.”
“Did they search for me?”
“Of course. With coast guard and with planes.”
“The ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see,” the old man said. He
noticed how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to instead of speaking only to
himself and to the sea. “I missed you,” he said. “What did you catch?” “One the first day.
One the second and two the third.”
[124] “Very good.”
“Now we fish together again.”
“No. I am not lucky. I am not lucky anymore.”
“The hell with luck,” the boy said. “I’ll bring the luck with me.”
“What will your family say?”
“I do not care. I caught two yesterday. But we will fish together now for I still have
much to learn.”
“We must get a good killing lance and always have it on board. You can make the
blade from a spring leaf from an old Ford. We can grind it in Guanabacoa. It should be
sharp and not tempered so it will break. My knife broke.”
“I’ll get another knife and have the spring ground.”
How many days of heavy brisa have we?”
“Maybe three. Maybe more.”
“I will have everything in order,” the boy said. “You get your hands well old man.”

“I know how to care for them. In the night I spat something strange and felt
something in my chest was broken.” “Get that well too,” the boy said. “Lie down, old man,
and I will bring you your clean shirt. And something to eat.”
[125] “Bring any of the papers of the time that I was gone,” the old man said.
“You must get well fast for there is much that I can learn and you can teach me
everything.
How much did you suffer?” “Plenty,” the old man said.
“I’ll bring the food and the papers,” the boy said. “Rest well, old man. I will bring
stuff from the drugstore for your hands.”
“Don’t forget to tell Pedrico the head is his.”
“No. I will remember.”
As the boy went out the door and down the worn coral rock road he was crying again.
That afternoon there was a party of tourists at the Terrace and looking down in the
water among the empty beer cans and dead barracudas a woman saw a great long white
spine with a huge tail at the end that lifted and swung with the tide while the east wind
blew a heavy steady sea outside the entrance to the harbour.
“What’s that?” she asked a waiter and pointed to the long backbone of the great fish
that was now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide.
“Tiburon,” the waiter said. “Shark.” He was meaning to explain what had happened.
“I didn’t know sharks had such handsome, beautifully formed tails.”
“I didn’t either,” her male companion said.
Up the road, in his shack, the old man was sleeping again. He was still sleeping on
his face and the boy was sitting by him watching him. The old man was dreaming about
the lions.
THE END.

Ernest Hemingway, Writer
• Born: 21 July 1899
• Birthplace: Oak Park, Illinois
• Died: 2 July 1961 (suicide)
• Best Known As: Famously manly author of For Whom the Bell
Tolls
Hemingway is one of the 20th century's most famous American writers. His
books include The Sun Also Rises (1926), A Farewell to Arms (1929), and For
Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Hemingway's plainspoken no-frills writing style
became so famous that it was (and is) frequently parodied. His dashing
machismo was almost as famous as his writing: he lived in Paris, Cuba and Key
West, fancied bullfighting and big game hunting, and served as a war
correspondent in WWII and the Spanish Civil War. He sealed his own notoriety
when he killed himself with a shotgun in 1961.
Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954...
Hemingway is sometimes called by his familiar nickname "Papa"... His
birthdate is sometimes listed in error as 1898. According to a 1954 article in the
New York Times, "In most reference books and in his own conversation he is
one year older because he gave 1898 as his birth date when he tried to enlist [in
the army] early in 1917, and stuck to that date ever since"... Hemingway's father
also committed suicide, shooting himself with a Civil War pistol in 1928.

The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway
www.Asiaing.com
To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

他是一个老人，独自一人在墨西哥湾的船上钓鱼，已经八十四天没有钓到一条鱼了。在头四十天里，有个男孩和他在一起。但是经过四十天没有钓到鱼，男孩的父母告诉他，这位老人现在确实是个倒霉透了的人，这是最倒霉的形式。男孩根据他们的命令，坐上了另一条船，第一周就捕捞到了三条好鱼。每天看到老人空着船回来，男孩感到很难过，他总是下去帮他扛回绕成一团的钓线、钩和鱼叉，还有缠绕在桅杆周围的帆。那块帆被面粉袋补丁修补着，收起来时看起来就像是永久失败的旗帜。
老人瘦瘦的，皮肤在脖子后面有深深的皱纹。阳光在热带海洋上的反射产生的仁慈的皮肤癌斑点出现在他的脸颊上，延伸到他脸部的两侧。双手上有处理重鱼绳时留下的深深皱纹的伤痕。但是这些伤痕都不是新的，它们就像沙漠中的侵蚀一样古老。
除了他的眼睛，一切都显得陈旧，而他的眼睛与海水的颜色一样，明亮而不屈。
“圣地亚哥，”男孩跟他说，当他们从拖上来的船边爬上了堤岸。“我可以再跟你一起去。我们已经赚了一些钱。”
老人教过男孩钓鱼，男孩很爱他。
“不，”老人说，“你已经找到一条幸运的船了。留在他们那里吧。”
“但是还记得你曾经八十七天没有钓到鱼，然后接着我们连续三周每天都钓到大鱼的情况吗？”

“I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”
“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”
“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
“He hasn’t much faith.”
[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”
“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff
home.”
“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he
was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did
not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted
their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful
fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried
them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

“是爸爸让我离开的。我是个孩子，我必须听他的话。”
“我知道，”老人说。“这很正常。”
“他并不怎么信任我。”
“不，”老人说。“但是我们信任。对吧？”
“是的，”男孩说。“我请你在露台上喝一杯，然后我们就回家拿东西吧。”
“为什么不呢？”老人说。“渔民间应该互相帮助。”
他们坐在露台上，许多渔民取笑老人，但他并没有生气。其他一些年长的渔民看着他，感到难过。但他们没有表露出来，他们客气地谈论着他们抛绳的深度以及目前的好天气，以及他们看到的一切。那天成功的渔民早已回来，已经把他们捕到的马林鱼的内脏剖出，并把它们横躺在两根木板上，每根木板的一端有两个人费力地扛着，然后等待着冰卡车把它们送往哈瓦那市场。抓到鲨鱼的人已经把它们送到了海湾对面的鲨鱼加工厂，那里有起重机把它们吊起来，把它们的肝脏取出来，切掉鳍，剥下皮，将肉切成条腌制。
当风来自东方时，从鲨鱼加工厂那边会飘来一股气味；但是今天，气味只有一丝丝，因为风从北方刮来然后停了下来，露台上阳光明媚，风景宜人。
“圣地亚哥，”男孩说。
“是的，”老人说。他正拿着杯子，想着多年前的事情。
“明天我可以帮你去买沙丁鱼吗？”
“不用了。去打棒球吧。我还可以划船，Rogelio会扔网。”
“我想去。如果不能和你一起捕鱼，我想以其他方式帮忙。”
“你请我喝了一杯啤酒。”老人说。“你已经是个男子汉了。”
“我第一次跟你坐船的时候有多大？”
“五岁，那时你差点被我把太绿的鱼带回来弄死。你还记得吗？”
“我记得尾巴拍打和敲击，座椅破碎和击打的声音。我记得你把我扔到船头，那里是湿漉漉的绳索，感觉整个船在轻微抖动，还有你击打他的声音就像砍树一样，然后甜腥的血腥味弥漫在我的周围。”
“你真的能记得那些吗，还是我只是告诉过你？”

“I remember everything from when we first went together.”
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’s
and your mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.”
“May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.”
“I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.”
“Let me get four fresh ones.”
“One,” the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they
were freshening as when the breeze rises.
“Two,” the boy said.
“Two,” the old man agreed. “You didn’t steal them?”
“I would,” the boy said. “But I bought these.”
“Thank you,” the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained
humility. But he [13] knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it
carried no loss of true pride.
“Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,” he said.
“Where are you going?” the boy asked.
“Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.”
“I’ll try to get him to work far out,” the boy said. “Then if you hook something truly
big we can come to your aid.”
“He does not like to work too far out.”
“No,” the boy said. “But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird
working and get
him to come out after dolphin.” “Are his eyes that bad?” “He is almost blind.” “It is
strange,” the old man said. “He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes.” “But
you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.”
“I am a strange old man”
“But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?”
“I think so. And there are many tricks.”
[14] “Let us take the stuff home,” the boy said. “So I can get the cast net and go after
the sardines.”
They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder

“我还记得我们第一次一起出海的时候的一切。”
老人用他那被太阳灼伤的，自信而充满爱意的眼睛看着他。
“如果你是我的孩子，我会带你出去赌博的，”他说。“但你是你父亲和母亲的孩子，并且你在一只幸运的船上。”
“我可以去找沙丁鱼吗？我知道还可以弄到四个诱饵。”
“今天我还有剩下的。我把它们放在盒子里用盐腌着。”
“让我再弄四个新鲜的。”
“一个，”老人说。他的希望和信心从未消失过。但现在它们又像微风一样清新了起来。
“两个，”男孩说。
“两个，”老人同意了。“你没偷吧？”
“我会偷，”男孩说。“但这些是我买的。”
“谢谢你，”老人说。他太简单了，不会想要成为谦卑之人。但他知道他已经变得谦卑了，而且他知道这并不丢人，也不失去了真正的自尊。
“明天会是个好日子，有了这样的潮流，”他说。
“你要去哪里？”男孩问。
“远离陆地，直到风势改变时再回来。我想在天还没亮之前离开。”
“我会努力让他在远处工作，”男孩说。“那样如果你钓到了真正大的鱼，我们就可以来帮忙。”
“他不喜欢在太远的地方工作。”
“是的，”男孩说。“但我会看见他看不到的东西，比如有鸟在找食，然后引他出来捕鱼。”
“他的眼睛那么糟糕吗？”
“他几乎瞎了。”
“真奇怪，”老人说。“他从来没捕过海龟。那就是会伤害眼睛的事。”
“但你在蚊子海岸捕海龟好多年，你的眼睛还好。”
“我是一个奇怪的老人。”
“但你现在有足够的力气去钓到一个真正大的鱼吗？”
“我想应该够了。而且有很多诀窍。”
“让我们把东西拿回家，”男孩说。“这样我就可以拿着投网去捕沙丁鱼了。”
他们从船上拿起装备。老人把桅杆放在肩上。

and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff
and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff
along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought
alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the
heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local
people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were
needless temptations to leave in a boat.
They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its
open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the
boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room
of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are
called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to
cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy
fibered [15] guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another
of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted
photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too
lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked.
“A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?”
“No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?”
“No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.”
“May I take the cast net?”
“Of course.”
There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went
through
this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this
too. “Eighty-five is a lucky number,” the old man said. “How would you like to see me
bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?” “I’ll get the cast net and go for
sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?”
[16] “Yes. I have yesterday’s paper and I will read the baseball.” The boy did not
know whether yesterday’s paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from
under the bed.
“Perico gave it to me at the bodega,” he explained. “I’ll be back when I have the
sardines. I’ll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.
When I come back you can tell me about the baseball.”
“The Yankees cannot lose.”
“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.”

男人和男孩一起搬运木船，上面盘着结实的棕色绳索，还有钩子

还有一根用来控制大鱼的棍子，当它们被拉到船边时使用。
没人敢偷老人的东西，但最好带帆和

毫无意义地将诱惑留在船里。
他们一起走上路，来到老人的棚屋，穿过
敞开的门进去。老人将带有捆绕帆的桅杆靠在墙上，
男孩把盒子和其他装备放在旁边。桅杆几乎与棚屋的一间房间一样长。
棚屋是用皇家棕榈的坚硬芽盾制成的，
称为guano，在里面有一张床、一张桌子、一把椅子，还有一个地板上
用木炭烹饪的地方。在坚固的guano叠层叶子的棕色墙壁上，
有一个耶稣圣心的彩色图片，还有一个

“一锅黄米饭和鱼。你想吃吗？”
“不，我会在家吃。你想我给生火吗？”
“不，我待会再生。或者我可能吃冷米饭。”
“我可以拿捕鱼网吗？”
“当然可以。”
他们没有捕鱼网，男孩记得他们曾经卖掉了。但他们每天都在进行

去捕沙丁鱼。你想坐在门口晒太阳吗？”
“好的。我有昨天的报纸，我会看棒球比赛。”男孩不知道
昨天的报纸是否也是虚构。但老人从床底拿了出来。

“You study it and tell me when I come back.”
“Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow
is the
eighty-fifth day.” “We can do that,” the boy said. “But what about the eighty-seven of
your great record?”
[17] “It could not happen twice. Do you think you can find an eighty-five?”
“I can order one.
“One sheet. That’s two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?”
“That’s easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half.”
“I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg.”
“Keep warm old man,” the boy said. “Remember we are in September.”
“The month when the great fish come,” the old man said. “Anyone can be a

“I go now for the sardines,” the boy said.
When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down.
The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and
over the old man’s shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very
old, and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old
man was asleep and his head fallen forward. His shirt had been patched so many times
that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun.
The [18] old man’s head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in
his face. The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the
evening breeze. He was barefooted.
The boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep.
“Wake up old man,” the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man’s knees.
The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way
away. Then he smiled.
“What have you got?” he asked.
“Supper,” said the boy. “We’re going to have supper.”

男孩从床上拿下旧军用毯子，铺在椅子背上和老人的肩膀上。那是奇怪的肩膀，虽然非常老，但依然强壮，脖子也很结实，当老人睡着时，皱纹也没有那么明显。他的衬衫已经补过很多次，就像船帆一样，补丁已经被太阳晒得颜色不一。老人的头非常老，闭着眼睛时，脸上毫无生气。报纸放在他的膝盖上，在晚风中他的手臂撑在那里。他光着脚。
男孩离开他，等他回来时，老人还在睡觉。

“Come on and eat. You can’t fish and not eat.”
“I have,” the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it. Then
he started to fold the blanket.
“Keep the blanket around you,” the boy said. “You’ll not fish without eating while I’m
alive.”
“Then live a long time and take care of yourself,” the old man said. “What are we

“Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew.”

“Martin. The owner.”

“He sent two beers.”
“I like the beer in cans best.”
“I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the bottles.”
“That’s very kind of you,” the old man said. “Should we eat?”
“I’ve been asking you to,” the boy told him gently. “I have not wished to open the
container until you were ready.”
[20] “I’m ready now,” the old man said. “I only needed time to wash.”
Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was two streets
down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good
towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter
and some sort of shoes and another blanket.

“我会给他一条大鱼的肚肉，”老人说，“他不止一次这样对我们了吧？”
“我想是的。”
“那我就得给他比肚肉更好的东西。他对我们太周到了。”
“他送了两瓶啤酒。”
“我最喜欢听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听听。”
“我知道。但这次是瓶装的，Hatuey啤酒，我会把瓶子还给他。”
“那太好了，”老人说，“我们来吃吗？”
“我一直在叫你吃，”男孩温柔地告诉他，“我不想在你准备好之前打开容器。”
“我现在准备好了。”老人说，“我只是需要时间洗漱。”
你在哪里洗的？男孩想着。村子的自来水源就在街上两条街远。我必须在这里为他准备好水，男孩想着，还有肥皂和一条好毛巾。我怎么这么糊涂呢？我得为他弄一件新衬衣和一件冬季夹克，还有一双鞋和一条毯子。

“Your stew is excellent,” the old man said.
“Tell me about the baseball,” the boy asked him.
“In the American League it is the Yankees as I said,” the old man said happily.”
“They lost today,” the boy told him.
“That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again.”
“They have other men on the team.”
“Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between Brooklyn and
Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives
In the old park.”
“There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen.”
“Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace?”
[21] “I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to
ask him and you were too timid.” “I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone
with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives.” “I would like to take the great
DiMaggio fishing,” the old man said. “They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was
as poor as we are and would understand.” “The great Sisler’s father was never poor and
he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age.” “When I was your
age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I
have seen lions on the beaches in the evening.”
“I know. You told me.”
“Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?”
“Baseball I think,” the boy said. “Tell me about the great John J. McGraw.” He said
Jota for J.
“He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough
and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as
baseball. At least he carried lists of [22] horses at all times in his pocket and frequently
spoke the names of horses on the telephone.”
“He was a great manager,” the boy said. “My father thinks he was the greatest.”
“Because he came here the most times,” the old man said. “If Durocher had
continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager.”
“Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?”
“I think they are equal.”
“And the best fisherman is you.”

“告诉我棒球的事吧，”男孩问他。
“就像我说的，在美国联盟中是洋基队，”老人开心地说道。
“他们今天输了，”男孩告诉他。
“那并不重要。伟大的迪马吉奥又复苏了。”
“他们队里还有其他人。”
“当然。但他是决定性的。在另一个联盟中，布鲁克林和费城之间我会选择布鲁克林。但我想起迪克·西斯勒和那些在老球场中的伟大长打。”
“从来没有过那样的。他击出了我见过的最长的一球。”
“你还记得他以前常来露台吗？”
“我想请他去钓鱼，但我太胆怯了，无法询问。后来我让你去问他，但你也胆怯。”
“我知道。那是个大错误。他本来可能会和我们一起去的。然后我们会终身难忘。”
“我想带着伟大的迪马吉奥去钓鱼，”老人说。“他们说他父亲是个渔夫。也许他像我们一样贫穷，会理解。”
“伟大的西斯勒的父亲从未穷过，他父亲在他现在这个年纪时就在大联盟中打球了。”
“当我像你这么大的时候，我曾经在一艘航行到非洲的帆船上当过甲板水手，晚上在海滩上看到了狮子。”
“我知道，你告诉过我。”
“我们该谈论非洲还是棒球呢？”
“我想是棒球，”男孩说。“告诉我关于伟大的约翰·J·麦格劳。”他用Jota来代替J。
“他以前也有时来露台。但当他喝酒时，他很粗鲁、刻薄，口头上很难对待。他的心里既惦记赛马又关注棒球。至少他总是在口袋里带着赛马名单，并经常在电话里提到赛马的名字。”
“他是个伟大的经理，”男孩说。“我父亲认为他是最伟大的。”
“因为他来这里的次数最多，”老人说。“如果杜罗切继续每年来这里，你父亲就会认为他是最伟大的经理。”
“谁才是真正的最伟大的经理，鲁克还是迈克·冈萨雷斯？”
“我认为他们是平等的。”
“而最优秀的渔夫就是你。”

“No. I know others better.”
“Que Va,” the boy said. “There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But
there is only you.”
“Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will
prove us wrong.”
“There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say.”
“I may not be as strong as I think,” the old man said. “But I know many tricks and I
have resolution.” “You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I
will take the things back to the Terrace.”
[23] “Good night then. I will wake you in the morning.”
“You’re my alarm clock,” the boy said.
“Age is my alarm clock,” the old man said. “Why do old men wake so early? Is it to
have one longer day?”
“I don’t know,” the boy said. “All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard.”
“I can remember it,” the old man said. “I’ll waken you in time.”
“I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior.”
“I know.”
“Sleep well old man.”
The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off
his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow,
putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the
other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.
He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the
long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high
capes and the great brown mountains. He lived along that coast now every night and in
his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats [24] come riding through it.
He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa
that the land breeze brought at morning.
Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the
boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early
in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the
sea and then he dreamed of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.
He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of
great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places
now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved
them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out
the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated

“不，我更了解其他人。”
“算了吧，”男孩说。“有很多优秀的渔夫，有一些伟大的渔夫。但是，只有你。”
“谢谢。你让我很开心。我希望没有鱼会出现得如此伟大以至于他会证明我们错了。”
“如果你像你说的那样还很强壮，就没有这样的鱼。”
“也许我并不像我想象中那样强壮，”老人说。“但是我有许多窍门和毅力。”“现在你应该去睡觉了，这样明天早上你就会精力充沛。我会把东西拿回露台。”
“那好，晚安。我会在早上叫你起床。”
“你是我的闹钟，”男孩说。
“老年就是我的闹钟，”老人说。“为什么老人们会起得这么早呢？是为了多过一天吗？”
“我不知道，”男孩说。“我只知道年轻人睡得迟又沉。”
“我记得，”老人说。“我会及时叫醒你。”
“我不喜欢他来叫醒我。好像我很次要一样。”
“我知道。”
“老人，睡个好觉。”
男孩走出去。他们没有开灯就吃饭，老人脱下裤子，在黑暗中上床睡觉。他卷起裤子做枕头，把报纸放在裤子里。裹着毯子睡在床弹簧上盖着的旧报纸上。
他很快就入睡了，梦见了他小时候在非洲的情景，长长的金色海滩和洁白的海滩，那些白得刺眼的海滩，还有高耸的海角和巍峨的棕色山峰。他现在每晚都在那片海岸上生活，梦中听到海浪的轰鸣，看到土著小船穿过海浪。他在睡觉时闻到船板上的松香和麻绳味，也闻到了晨风带来的非洲气息。
通常当他闻到陆地的风味时，就会醒来穿衣服去叫醒男孩。但是今晚陆地风味来得太早了，他知道这在梦中太早，继续梦见海湾里升起的白色山峰，然后梦见加那利群岛不同的港口和停泊处。
他不再梦见风暴，也不再梦见女人，不再梦见重大事件，大鱼，争斗，力量竞争，也不再梦见妻子。他现在只梦见地方和海滩上的狮子。它们在黄昏中像小猫一样戏耍，他像爱男孩一样爱它们。他从未梦见过男孩。他只是醒来，看着敞开的门外的月亮，卷起他的裤子穿上。他小便。

outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy. He was shivering with the
morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be
rowing.
The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and
walked in quietly with his [25] bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and
the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He
took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him.
The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting
on the bed, pulled them on.
The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the
old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, “I am sorry.”
“Qua Va,” the boy said. “It is what a man must do.”
They walked down the road to the old man’s shack and all along the road, in the dark,
barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.
When they reached the old man’s shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket
and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his
shoulder.
“Do you want coffee?” the boy asked.
“We’ll put the gear in the boat and then get some.”
They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served
fishermen.
“How did you sleep old man?” the boy asked. He [26] was waking up now although it
was still hard for him to leave his sleep.
“Very well, Manolin,” the old man said. “I feel confident today.”
“So do I,” the boy said. “Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits.
He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything.”
“We’re different,” the old man said. “I let you carry things when you were five years
old.”
“I know it,” the boy said. “I’ll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit
here.”
He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were
stored.
The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew
that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a
lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the

在小屋外停了一下，然后沿着路走去叫醒男孩。他因为清晨的寒冷而打颤。但他知道自己会因为打颤而变暖和，很快就会开始划船。
男孩住的房子的门没有锁，他打开门，赤脚悄悄走进去。男孩在第一个房间的小床上睡着了，老人可以清楚地看到他，因为从将要消逝的月光中射进了光。他轻轻地抓住男孩的一只脚，握着，直到男孩醒来，转过身来看着他。
老人点了点头，男孩从床边的椅子上拿起他的裤子，坐在床上穿上了裤子。
老人走出门，男孩跟在他后面。他困倦地，老人将胳膊搭在他肩膀上，说：“对不起。”
“去吧，”男孩说。“这是一个男人必须要做的。”
他们沿着路走到老人的小屋，整个路上，在黑暗中，赤脚的人们正在移动，搬运着他们的船桅。
当他们到达老人的小屋时，男孩把篮子里的绳子卷起来，拿过鱼叉和捕鱼叉，老人肩上扛着带着收折帆的桅杆。
“你想喝咖啡吗？”男孩问。
“我们把装备放在船上，然后去喝。”他们在一个为渔民提供服务的清晨咖啡馆里用罐装炼乳喝咖啡。
“老人，你睡得怎么样？”男孩问道。虽然他现在正在醒来，但离开睡梦对他来说仍然很困难。
“很好，马里奴，”老人说。“我今天感觉很自信。”
“我也是，”男孩说。“现在我得去拿你和我的沙丁鱼和新鲜鱼饵。他自己带来我们的装备。他从来不让别人搬运任何东西。”
“我们不一样，”老人说。“你五岁的时候我让你搬东西。”
“我知道，”男孩说。“我马上就回来。再来一杯咖啡吧。我们在这里有信用。”
他光着脚走到珊瑚岩上的冰库，拿鱼饵。
老人慢慢喝着咖啡。这是他整天唯一会喝的东西，他知道他应该把它喝下去。很长一段时间以来，吃东西已经让他感到无聊，他从不带午餐。他在小船的船头上有一瓶水，这就是他整天所需要的一切。

The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper
and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and
lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.
[27] “Good luck old man.”
“Good luck,” the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole
pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row
out of the harbour in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going out
to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see
them now the moon was below the hills.
Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except
for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour
and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man
knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the
clean early morning smell of the ocean. He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in
the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well
because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish
congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of
the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools
of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the
wandering fish fed on them.
In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the
trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made
as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his
principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate
dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought,
the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong
ones. Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean
can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so
suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are
made too delicately for the sea.
He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when
they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always
said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys
as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought [29] when the shark livers had
brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a
contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as
feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or
wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a
woman, he thought.
He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his
speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current.
He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he
was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.

男孩拿着沙丁鱼和两个鱼饵包裹在报纸中回来了，他们沿着小径走到小船边，感受着脚底下的卵石沙，然后抬起小船，将她滑入水中。

“好运，老人。”

“好运。”老人说着。他将桨的绳子捆在桨架上，靠在桨在水中推动的力量上，开始在黑暗中划出港口。从其他海滩也有其他船只出海，老人听到他们划桨的声音，尽管他现在看不见它们，因为月亮已经落在山下。

有时有人在船上说话。但大多数船只都是静默的，除了桨的划动声。他们离开港口口之后分开，每一个都朝着希望找到鱼的海域驶去。老人知道自己要划很远，他把陆地的气味抛在身后，划向清晨海洋的清新味道。他看到海洋中的海鬼燃烧，因为那是渔民所称的“大井”的一部分，那里有一处突然的七百尋的深度，各种鱼类因为洋流在海底的陡峭墙壁上卷成一团。

在黑暗中，老人感受到了早晨的到来，他听到了飞鱼离水后发出的颤抖声和它们的坚硬翅膀在黑暗中飞翔时发出的嘶嘶声。他非常喜欢飞鱼，因为它们是他在海洋中的主要伙伴。他对鸟类感到遗憾，尤其是那些总是飞翔、看着、几乎从不找到猎物的小巧黑色燕鸥，他想，这些鸟的生活比我们艰难得多，除了强势的捕食鸟和强壮的大鸟。为什么他们要把如海燕那样纤细精致的鸟类放在海洋中，当海洋可以如此残酷呢？她是善良的，而且非常美丽。但她也可以如此残忍，而这一切来得如此突然，这样飞翔、俯冲和猎食的鸟类，用着它们微小悲伤的声音，对海洋来说也太过精致了。

他总是把海洋称为“la mar”，这是人们在西班牙语中爱她的时候所称呼的。有时那些爱她的人会说她的坏话，但这些话总是像在谈论一个女人一样说的。一些年轻的渔民，那些在用浮标当作钓鱼线浮漂器的人，那些拥有机动船的人，当鲨肝带来很多钱时买的，把她称为“el mar”，这是阳性。他们把她看作一个竞争者、一个地方，甚至是一个敌人。但老人总是把她看作是女性的，把她看作是能给予或拒绝重大善待的东西，如果她做出疯狂或邪恶的事情，那只是因为她无法控制自己。月亮像对待女人一样影响着她，他想。

他一直在稳步地划着船，这对他来说并不费力，因为他保持在自己的速度之内，而海洋表面平整，除了偶尔出现的洋流涡流。他让洋流做了三分之一的工作，当天开始亮了起来，他发现自己已经比他希望的这个时候更远了。

I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I’ll work out
where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them.
Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. One bait
was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were
down in the blue
water at one [30] hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait
hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and
all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh
sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on
the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was
not sweet smelling and good tasting.
The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two
deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow
jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the
excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a
big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait
would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made
fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three
hundred fathoms of line.
Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed
gently to keep the [31] lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite
light and any moment now the sun would rise.
The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on
the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was
brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back
at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down
into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water.
He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the
stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that
swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty
fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.
But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who
knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather
be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.
The sun was two hours higher now and it did not [32] hurt his eyes so much to look
into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far
inshore.
All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the
evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the
evening too. But in the morning it is painful.
Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky
ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then

我在深井工作了一周，什么也没捕到，他想。今天我会找到鲔鱼和白条金枪鱼的群集地，也许会有一条大的在其中。
天还没有真正亮的时候，他已经把鱼饵放出去，随着洋流漂浮。一个鱼饵停在四十法耳深处。第二个停在七十五法耳，第三和第四个在一百一十和一百二十五法耳深处的蓝色海水中。每个鱼饵都是头朝下，鱼钩的杆被插入鱼饵内部，牢牢地绑好，所有露出的部分，曲线和尖端都被新鲜的沙丁鱼覆盖。每一条沙丁鱼都是两只眼睛被钩起来，形成一条半花环挂在鱼钩上。鱼钩上没有一点是大鱼能够感觉到的，它们都散发着香甜的味道和诱人的滋味。
男孩给了他两条新鲜的小金枪鱼，或者白条金枪鱼，挂在两根最深的钓线上像坠子一样，其他的则是用过的大蓝色鱼和黄色的杰克鱼；但它们还是处于良好状态，并且有优质的沙丁鱼为它们带来香味和吸引力。每根线都像一支大铅笔那么粗，套在一根有生气的绿色木棍上，这样一旦有鱼来咬饵，木棍就会下陷，而每根线都有两个四十法耳的盘绕，可以固定在其他空盘绕上，以便需要时，鱼可以拉出三百多法耳的线。
现在男人看着船身边沿的三根木棍的下沉，轻轻划着船使钓鱼线保持垂直向上和按照适当的深度。天已经相当明亮，太阳马上就要升起。
太阳在海面上稀稀拉拉地升起，老人能看到其他小船，低低地在水面上，靠近海岸散布开来。然后太阳变得更明亮，光芒照在水面上，然后它升起得很清晰，平静的海面将它反射回他的眼睛，刺得他眼睛生疼，他只能不看太阳划船。他低头看着水下，观察着钓线直直地延伸到黑暗的水中。他让它们比任何人都更直，以便在溪流的黑暗中的每个层次，准备着任何游过的鱼。其他人让它们随着洋流漂移，有时在渔民认为它们在一百法耳时，实际上只有六十法耳。
但是，他想，我把它们保持得非常准确。只是我再也没有运气了。但谁知道呢？也许今天。每一天都是新的一天。比较幸运要好。但我宁愿精确。这样当运气来临时，你就准备好了。
太阳现在已经高了两个小时，不再刺得他的眼睛那么疼，可以看向东方。现在只看到三只小船，它们都很低，离海岸很远。
我的一生，清晨的太阳总是刺痛我的眼睛，他想。然而它们还是好的。傍晚我可以直视而不觉得黑暗。傍晚的太阳力量更加强大。但是在早晨就令人疼痛。
就在这时，他看到一只军舰鸟展开它那双黑色的长翼在他前方的天空中盘旋。它迅速俯冲，斜倾着身子，展开后掠的翅膀，然后 - 11 -

circled again.
“He’s got something,” the old man said aloud. “He’s not just looking.”
He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry
and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he
was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to
use the bird.
The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. Then he dove
suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over
the surface.
[33] “Dolphin,” the old man said aloud. “Big dolphin.”
He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire
leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go
over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line
and left it coiled in the shade of the bow. He went back to rowing and to watching the
long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water.
As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then
swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could
see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping
fish. The dolphin were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be
in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped. It is a big school of dolphin, he
thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has no
chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.
He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements
of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too
fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up [34] a stray and perhaps my big fish is around
them. My big fish must be somewhere.
The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long
green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that
it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in
the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them
go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton
because it meant fish. The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was
higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird
was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some
patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent,
gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating dose beside the boat. It turned on
its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple
filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.
“Agua mala,” the man said. “You whore.”
From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw

他慢慢而稳定地划着船，朝着鸟盘旋的地方前进。他没有着急，而且保持着钓线直直的上下摆动。但他稍微顺着潮流，这样尽管钓鱼的速度比平常快了一些，但依然正确。如果他没有尝试利用这只鸟的话，他本应该的钓鱼速度会更慢。
这只鸟在空中飞得更高，再次开始盘旋，它的翅膀一动不动。然后它突然俯冲下去，老人看到飞鱼从水里蹿了出来，绝望地滑过水面。
“海豚，”老人大声说，“大海豚。”
他收了桨，从船头下面拿出一根小线。它有一根钢丝领子和一个适中大小的钩子，他用沙丁鱼饵了它。他让它沿舷边下去，然后把它牢牢地固定在船尾的一个环眼上。然后他再饵了另一根线，放在船头的阴凉处盘起来。他又回去划船，继续观察那只长翼的黑鸟，它现在低低地在水面上飞行。
当他看着那只鸟再次俯冲时，他可以看到大海豚追随着逃走的鱼所掀起的水面微微鼓动的变化。海豚们在飞鱼飞行的下方划过水面，当鱼掉落时，它们便在水中高速前进。这是一大群海豚，他心想。它们广布在水面上，飞鱼几乎没什么机会逃脱。鸟也没有机会，飞鱼对它们来说太大了，速度太快了。
他注视着飞鱼一次又一次冲出水面，以及那只鸟的无效动作。他心想那群鱼已经离我远去，它们离开得太快太远了。但也许我会捡到一条遗漏的，也许我的大鱼就在它们附近。我的大鱼一定在某个地方。
现在陆地上的云像山一样高耸，海岸只是一条长长的绿线，后面是灰蓝色的山丘。现在的水变成了深蓝色，几乎是紫色。当他凝视着水面时，他看到暗哑的水中漂浮着浮游生物，还有太阳现在散发的奇特光芒。他看着自己的钓线直直地沉入水中，看到那么多浮游生物，他感到很开心，因为那意味着有鱼。太阳现在更高了，水面上出现了那么奇特的光芒，这意味着天气很好，云彩遮挡住了陆地。但那只鸟现在几乎看不见了，水面上除了一些黄色、经过日晒的苔藓和一块紫色、形式化的、彩虹般的、明胶状的葡萄牙战舰部分还漂浮在船旁。它翻了个身，然后恢复原状。它像一个气泡一样愉快地漂浮着，它那长长致命的紫色丝状物在水中拖着一码长。
“致命海蜇，”老人说，“你这个婊子。”
他轻轻摇着桨，看着水面下面——

the tiny fish that [35] were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them
and under the small shade the bubble made as it drifted. They were immune to its poison.
But men were not and when same of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there
slimy and purple while the old man was working a fish, he would have welts and sores on
his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak can give. But these
poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash.
The iridescent bubbles were beautiful. But they were the falsest thing in the sea and
the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating them. The turtles saw them,
approached them from the front, then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced
and ate them filaments and all. The old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he
loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on
them with the horny soles of his feet.
He loved green turtles and hawk-bills with their elegance and speed and their great
value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their
armour-plating, strange in their [36] love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese
men-of-war with their eyes shut.
He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many
years. He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff
and weighed a ton. Most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle’s heart will
beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered. But the old man thought, I have
such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs. He ate the white eggs to give
himself strength. He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for
the truly big fish.
He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where
many of the fishermen kept their gear. It was there for all fishermen who wanted it. Most
fishermen hated the taste. But it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose
and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes.
Now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.
“He’s found fish,” he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no
scattering of bait [37] fish. But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air,
turned and dropped head first into the water. The tuna shone silver in the sun and after
he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in
all directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait. They were
circling it and driving it.
If they don’t travel too fast I will get into them, the old man thought, and he watched
the school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait
fish that were forced to the surface in their panic.
“The bird is a great help,” the old man said. Just then the stern line came taut under
his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt tile weight
of the small tuna’s shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in.
The shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the
water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat. He

他喜欢绿海龟和角海龟的优雅与速度以及它们的巨大价值，对那些巨大而愚蠢的硬壳海龟，像它们铠甲上的黄色，爱侣间奇怪的行为，以及他们闭着眼睛吃着葡萄牙战舰的姿态，他有一种友好的鄙视。
尽管他多年来一直乘着海龟船出海，但他并不崇拜海龟。他为它们感到难过，甚至是那些像木舟一样长，重达一吨的大鼻龟。大多数人对待海龟都很无情，因为一个海龟的心脏在被割开屠杀后还能跳动数小时。但老人想道：我也有一颗这样的心，并且我的脚和手与它们一样。他吃下白色的鸡蛋以增加力量。他从五月开始吃，在九月和十月保持强壮，以便应对那些真正大的鱼。
他每天也喝一杯来自小屋大桶里的鲨鱼肝油。那里是许多渔民存放装备的地方，每个想要的渔民都可以拿。大多数渔民都讨厌那个味道。但与起床的时候相比，也算不上什么。这种油对抗各种感冒和流行感冒都很有效，还对眼睛有好处。

lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring
as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering
strokes of his neat, fast-moving [38] tail. The old man hit him on the head for kindness
and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern.
“Albacore,” he said aloud. “He’ll make a beautiful bait. He’ll weigh ten pounds.”
He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself.
He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes
when he was alone steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats. He had
probably started to talk aloud, when alone, when the boy had left. But he did not
remember. When he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was
necessary. They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad weather. It was
considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had always
considered it so and respected it. But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since
there was no one that they could annoy.
“If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy,” he said
aloud. “But since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in
their boats and to bring them the baseball.”
[39] Now is no time to think of baseball, he thought. Now is the time to think of only
one thing. That which I was born for. There might be a big one around that school, he
thought. I picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding. But they are
working far out and fast. Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and
to the north-east. Can that be the time of day? Or is it some sign of weather that I do not
know?
He could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that
showed white as though they were snow-capped and the clouds that looked like high
snow mountains above them. The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the
water. The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was
only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines
going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.
The tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished
among them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for
baits, were down again. The sun was [40] hot now and the old man felt it on the back of
his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back as he rowed.
I could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake
me. But today is eighty-five days and I should fish the day well.
Just then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.
“Yes,” he said. “Yes,” and shipped his oars without bumping the boat. He reached out
for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. He felt
no strain nor weight and he held the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a
tentative pull, not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred
fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and the shank of

“鲔鱼，”他大声说。“它会成为漂亮的诱饵。它将重十磅。”
他记不得他什么时候开始独自大声说话了。在过去，他独自一人的时候会唱歌，有时在夜晚独自一人驾驶渔船或海龟船的时候也会唱歌。也许是在男孩离开后，他才开始独自 大声说话。但他不记得了。当他和男孩一起钓鱼时，他们通常只在必要的时候说话。他们在夜晚或被恶劣天气困住的时候会说话。在海上不多说话被认为是一种美德，老人一直是这样认为并尊重这一点。但现在他常常会大声说出自己的想法，因为没有人会觉得他们很讨厌。
“如果别人听到我大声说话，他们会认为我疯了，”他大声说。“但既然我不疯，我也不在乎。富人有收音机可以跟他们说话，在他们的船上带来棒球。”
现在不是想棒球的时候，他想道。现在只有想一件事的时候。我为生而来的那个事。可能有一只大的在这群鱼中间，他想道。我只捕捉到了一只跟着鲔鱼一起吃东西的落单者。但它们远远地在海面上工作，而且速度很快。今天露出水面的所有东西都在向东北方迅速前进。那可能是白天的时间吗？还是我不知道的气象征象？
他现在看不到海岸的绿色，只能看到蓝色的山峰尖顶，白色的，好像是积雪的样子，还有看起来像白雪覆盖的高山一样的云。海面非常黑暗，光线在水中做出透明体。现在太阳很高，浮游生物的许多小点已经被高高的太阳抵消，老人只能看到碧蓝海水中巨大的透明体，他的钓鱼线笔直地伸入深达一英里的水中。
渔夫们称所有这种鱼为金枪鱼，只有在出售它们或用它们换鱼饵时，才会按它们的正确名称进行区分。现在它们又下去了。太阳现在很热，老人感到脖子后面很热，感到汗水顺着背脊往下滴。
我可以漂流，他想道，睡觉时把绳子绕在我的脚趾上来叫醒我。但今天已经是第八十五天了，我应该好好钓鱼。
就在此时，他看着自己的渔线，看到其中一根伸出的绿色竿急剧下沉。
“是的，”他说。“是的，”然后收起桨，没让船碰到其他物体。他伸手去抓住渔线，轻轻地夹住它，用右手的大拇指和食指。他感觉不到任何压力或重量，轻轻地持住渔线。接着又来了。这一次是试探性的拉扯，不是很坚实也不很重，他准确地知道那是什么。一百个深矿下面，一条旗鱼正在吃覆盖在钓具头和鱼钩上的沙丁鱼。

the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head of the small tuna.
The old man held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand, unleashed it from
the stick. Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension.
This far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought. Eat them, fish. Eat them.
Please eat them.
[41] How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the
dark. Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them. He felt the light
delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine’s head must have been more
difficult to break from the hook. Then there was nothing.
“Come on,” the old man said aloud. “Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren’t they
lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don’t be
shy, fish. Eat them.”
He waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it and the other
lines at the same time for the fish might have swum up or down. Then came the same
delicate pulling touch again.
“He’ll take it,” the old man said aloud. “God help him to take it.”
He did not take it though. He was gone and the old man felt nothing.
“He can’t have gone,” he said. “Christ knows he can’t have gone. He’s making a turn.
Maybe he
has been hooked before and he remembers something of it.
[42] Then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy.
“It was only his turn,” he said. “He’ll take it.”
He was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and
unbelievably heavy. It was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down, down,
down, unrolling off the first of the two reserve coils. As it went down, slipping lightly
through the old man’s fingers, he still could feel the great weight, though the pressure of
his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible. “What a fish,” he said. “He has it
sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it.”
Then he will turn and swallow it, he thought. He did not say that because he knew
that if you said a good thing it might not happen. He knew what a huge fish this was and
he thought of him moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his
mouth. At that moment he felt him stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the
weight increased and he gave more line. He tightened the pressure of his thumb and
finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going straight down.
[43] “He’s taken it,” he said. “Now I’ll let him eat it well.”
He let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and
made fast the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the
next line. Now he was ready. He had three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as

钩子从小金枪鱼的头部突出出来。

老人用左手轻轻地握住线，从杆子上解开线。现在他可以让线在手指间滑动，而鱼感觉不到任何张力。他想在这么远的地方，这个月里一定有巨大的鱼。吃吧，鱼。请吃吧。

[41] 那些新鲜的鱼，在那冰冷黑暗的六百英尺深的水里。在黑暗中再转一圈，然后回来吃掉它们。他感受到轻盈细致的牵拉，接着一个更强烈的牵拉，当一条沙丁鱼的头很难从钓钩上脱开时。然后什么都没有了。

“来吧，”老人大声说道。“再转一圈。闻一下。它们是不是美味？现在好好地吃，然后是金枪鱼。坚硬冰冷美丽。别害羞，鱼。吃了它们。”

他用大拇指和食指之间的线，看着它又看着其他的线，因为鱼可能上下游动。然后又来了同样的轻盈牵拉。

“他会接住的，”老人大声说道。“上帝帮助他接住。”

尽管他没有接住。他消失了，老人什么感觉也没有。

“他不能消失，”他说。“天晓得他不能消失。他在转弯。也许他之前被钓过，现在还记得些什么。”

[42] 然后他感受到线上的轻轻的触感，他高兴起来。

“只是他的轮到了，”他说。“他会接住的。”

他高兴地感受到轻盈的牵拉，接着感觉到一些沉重得难以置信。那是鱼的重量，他让线滑下去，下去，下去，从两个保留线圈的第一个上解开。随着线轻轻在老人的手指间滑动，他仍然能感受到巨大的重量，尽管他的拇指和食指的压力几乎感觉不到。“多么大的鱼啊，”他说。“它现在横着口中拿着。”

然后他会转过来吞下去，他想。他没有说，因为他知道如果你说一个好事，可能就不会发生。他知道这是一条多么巨大的鱼，他想象着它在黑暗中拿着金枪鱼横过口中游开。就在那一刻，他感觉到它停止了移动，但重量还在那里。接着重量增加了，他放出更多的线。他暂时加大了拇指和食指的压力，重量增加并直直往下。 

[43]“它接住了，”他说。“现在我让它好好地吃吧。”

他让线在手指间滑动，同时用左手伸下去，将两个保留线圈的自由端绑在下一根线的两个保留线圈的圈中。现在他准备好了。现在他已经有了三个四十英寻的线圈储备，-15-

well as the coil he was using.
“Eat it a little more,” he said. “Eat it well.”
Eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you, he thought.
Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you. All right. Are you ready? Have you
been long enough at table?
“Now!” he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of line and
then struck again and again, swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the
strength of his arms and the pivoted weight of his body.
Nothing happened. The fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise
him an inch. His line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his hack
until it was so taut that beads of water were jumping from it. Then it began to make a
slow hissing sound in the water and he still held it, bracing [44] himself against the
thwart and leaning back against the pull. The boat began to move slowly off toward the
north-west.
The fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water. The other baits
were still in the water but there was nothing to be done.
“I wish I had the boy” the old man said aloud. “I’m being towed by a fish and I’m the
towing bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I
can and give him line when he must have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going
down.”
What I will do if he decides to go down, I don’t know. What I’ll do if he sounds and
dies I don’t know. But I’ll do something. There are plenty of things I can do.
He held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff
moving steadily to the north-west.
This will kill him, the old man thought. He can’t do this forever. But four hours later
the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old man was still
braced solidly with the line across his back.
[45] “It was noon when I hooked him,” he said. “And I have never seen him.”
He had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it
was cutting his forehead. He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being
careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the
water bottle with one hand. He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the
bow. He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to
endure.
Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible. That makes no
difference, he thought. I can always come in on the glow from Havana. There are two
more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will come up before that. If he doesn’t
maybe he will come up with the moon. If he does not do that maybe he will come up with
the sunrise. I have no cramps and I feel strong. It is he that has the hook in his mouth.

他用的鱼钩和鱼线都很坚固。
“再吃一点儿，”他说。“吃饱了。”
吃到鱼钩刺进你的心脏，把你杀死，他心想。
轻轻浮上来，让我用鱼叉刺进你。好了。准备好了吗？你在餐桌上待够久了吗？
“现在！”他大声说道，双手用力一击，拉出一码线，然后再次重击，不停地用两只手交替摆动，全力挽动身体的重量。
什么也没有发生。鱼慢慢游走，老人举不起他一寸。他的鱼线坚固，适用于大鱼，他靠着背部拉着它，直到水珠从中跳出。然后，在水中开始发出慢慢的嘶嘶声，他仍然用力拉着，倚着座椅靠背，抵抗拖拽的力量，船慢慢向西北方向移动。
鱼稳步前行，他们在平静的水中缓慢前行。其他诱饵还在水中，但却无计可施。
“但愿有个小伙子在身边。”老人大声说道。“我被一条鱼拖着，而我却是被拖的铁轨。我可以把鱼线固定住。但它可能会断。我必须尽全力拉住他，并在他需要拉线的时候给他。感谢上帝，他在前行，而不是下沉。”
如果他决定下沉，我该怎么办，我不知道。如果他下沉而死，我也不知道。但我会有所作为。我可以做出许多事情。
他把鱼线压在背上，看着它在水中的倾斜和小船稳步向西北方向行驶。
这会把他累死，老人心想。他无法永远这样游泳。但四个小时后，鱼仍在稳步游向海中，拖着小船，老人依然坚定地抵着背上的鱼线。
“中午我钓到他的，”他说。“但我从未仔细看过他。”
他在钓到鱼之前把草帽戴得紧紧的，压在头上，正在划伤他的前额。他也口渴，跪下来，小心翼翼地不要拉扯鱼线，尽可能地进入船头，用一只手拿起水瓶。他打开瓶盖，喝了一口。然后他倚在船头上休息。他坐在未卸下的桅杆和帆上休息，努力不去思考，努力忍耐。
然后他看向身后，看到没有陆地可见。这并不重要，他想。我总可以凭哈瓦那的光来回航。太阳还有两小时才落山，也许他会在那之前浮出水面。如果他没出现，也许他会随月亮浮出水面。如果他也不这样做，也许他会在日出时浮出水面。我没有抽筋，感觉很强壮。是他嘴里有钩。

But what a fish to pull like that. He must have his mouth shut tight on the wire. I wish I
could see him. I wish I could see him only once to know what I have against me.
The fish never changed his course nor his direction [46] all that night as far as the
man could tell from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the old
man’s sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs. During the day he had
taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry. After the sun
went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back and he
cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now. The sack
cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he
was almost comfortable. The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he
thought of it as almost comfortable.
I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought. Not as long as
he keeps this up.
Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and
checked his course. The line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight
out from his shoulders. They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was
not so strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward. If I lose
the glare of Havana we must be going more to the eastward, he thought. For if the fish’s
course held true I must see it for many more [47] hours. I wonder how the baseball came
out in the grand leagues today, he thought. It would be wonderful to do this with a radio.
Then he thought, think of it always. Think of what you are doing. You must do nothing
stupid.
Then he said aloud, “I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this.”
No one should be alone in their old age, he thought. But it is unavoidable. I must
remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong. Remember, no matter
how little you want to, that you must eat him in the morning. Remember, he said to
himself.
During the night two porpoises came around the boat and he could hear them rolling
and blowing. He could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male made and
the sighing blow of the female.
“They are good,” he said. “They play and make jokes and love one another. They are
our brothers like the flying fish.”
Then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked. He is wonderful and strange
and who knows how old he is, he thought. Never have I had such a strong fish nor one
who acted so strangely. Perhaps he is too wise to jump. He could ruin me by jumping or
[48] by a wild rush. But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows
that this is how he should make his fight. He cannot know that it is only one man against
him, nor that it is an old man. But what a great fish he is and what will he bring in the
market if the flesh is good. He took the bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his
fight has no panic in it. I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as desperate as I am?
He remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin. The male fish

但是那样拉的鱼是多么的强大啊。它一定是在牢牢地闭紧嘴巴咬住了钓丝。我希望我能看到它。我希望我能看到它只一次，知道我面对的是什么。

整个夜晚，鱼都没有改变它的方向和航线，至少从老人观察星星的方向来看是这样的。太阳落山后天气变冷了，老人的汗在背部、手臂和老腿上都冷冷地干了。白天时，他把盖着鱼饵箱的麻袋拿出来晒干。太阳落山后，他把它系在脖子上，让它垂到背后，小心翼翼地把它缠在现在横在肩膀上的钓丝下面。麻袋缓冲了钓丝，他还找到了一种方式往前倾，靠在船头上，这样他几乎感觉舒服。这个姿势实际上只是略微能忍受一点；但他把它当做是几乎舒服的。

他想：他对我没法子，我也对他没法子。只要他继续这么干下去。

他曾一次站起来，在船舷边上撒尿，看着星星，核对航向。钓丝就像一条磷光般的线，在水中从他的肩膀伸直出来。现在他们移动得更慢了，哈瓦那的光也不再那么强烈，所以他知道洋流一定在把他们往东边带。如果我失去了哈瓦那的模糊光，我们一定在向东边走，他心想。如果鱼的方向真实不变的话，那我还得看上好几个小时。他想，今天大联盟的棒球比赛结果怎么样了。如果能有收音机一起来干这事就太好了。然后他想，要时刻留心。要想清楚你在干什么。别做傻事。

然后他大声说道：“我希望有男孩在。帮我一把，也让他看看这个。”

一个人在晚年不应该独自一人，他想。但这是无可避免的。我得记住在吞服金枪鱼前把它吃掉，以保持体力。记住，不管你有多不想，早上一定要吃掉它。记住，他对自己说。

夜里，两只海豚绕着船游来游去，他能听到它们翻滚和喷气声。他能听出雄海豚发出的喷气声和雌海豚的吐气声之间的区别。

“它们很好，”他说。“它们玩耍，开玩笑，互相爱护。它们是我们的兄弟，就像飞鱼。”

接着他开始可怜起他钓到的那条大鱼来。它是如此奇妙和陌生，而谁知道它多大年纪呢，他想。从来没有人和一条如此强壮、如此古怪的鱼交手过。也许它太聪明不跳吧。它可能会通过跳跃或疯狂地冲撞来毁掉我。但也许它之前已被钓到过很多次，它知道这就是它该展开的战斗方式。它不知道这只是一个人与它对抗，也不知道这是一个老人。但它是一条多么伟大的鱼啊，如果它的肉好的话，它能买到多少钱。它像雄性一样上了钓饵，像雄性一样拉扯，它的战斗中没有惊慌。我想知道它是否有什么计划，或者它和我一样绝望吗？

他想起了曾经钓到一对马林鱼中的一条雄鱼。雄鱼...

scythe and almost of that size and shape. When the old man had gaffed her and clubbed
her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and dubbing her across the top of her
head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then, with
the boy’s aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat. Then,
while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, [49] the male fish
jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down
deep, his lavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide
lavender stripes showing. He was beautiful, the old man remembered, and he had stayed.
That was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought. The boy was
sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly.
“I wish the boy was here,” he said aloud and settled himself against the rounded
planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his
shoulders moving steadily toward whatever he had chosen.
When once, through my treachery, it had been necessary to him to make a choice,
the old man thought.
His choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and
traps and treacheries. My choice was to go there to find him beyond all people. Beyond all
people in the world. Now we are joined together and have been since noon. And no one to
help either one of us.
Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought. But that was the thing that
I was born for. I must surely remember to eat the tuna after it gets light.
[50] Some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were behind
him. He heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff.
In the darkness he loosened his sheath knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his
left shoulder he leaned back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale. Then he
cut the other line closest to him and in the dark made the loose ends of the reserve coils
fast. He worked skillfully with the one hand and put his foot on the coils to hold them as
he drew his knots tight. Now he had six reserve coils of line. There were two from each
bait he had severed and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all
connected.
After it is light, he thought, I will work back to the forty-fathom bait and cut it away
too and link up the reserve coils. I will have lost two hundred fathoms of good Catalan
cardel and the hooks and leaders. That can be replaced. But who replaces this fish if I
hook some fish and it cuts him off?
I don’t know what that fish was that took the bait just now. It could have been a
marlin or a broadbill or a shark. I never felt him. I had to get rid of him too fast.
Aloud he said, “I wish I had the boy.”

总让母鱼先吃，并且被钓上的鱼，也就是雌鱼，开始了一场狂野、恐慌、绝望的斗争，很快就耗尽了她的力量，而雄鱼一直陪伴在她身边，越过钓线与她共舞在水面上。他待得如此近，以至老人担心他会用尾巴划断钓线，因为那尾巴锋利如镰刀，大小形状也几乎一样。当老人用钩子钩住她，用棍子敲击她，握住的螯和其带有砂纸般边缘的螯，轻敲她的头顶直到她的颜色变成几乎像镜子背面一样的颜色，然后，在男孩的帮助下，将她吊到船上时，雄鱼一直待在船的旁边。然后，当老人整理渔线、准备鱼叉时，雄鱼跳到船旁的空中来看看雌鱼在哪里，然后下潜，他那薰衣草色的翅膀，也就是他的胸鳍，展开得很宽，他所有明显的薰衣草色条纹都展现出来。老人记得他是多么美丽，而他一直留下来。老人想，那是我见过他们的最令人悲伤的事情。男孩也很伤心，我们向她道歉，迅速将她宰杀。
“我希望男孩在这里，”他大声说道，然后靠在船头圆滑的木板上，感受着他肩上所承受的巨大鱼的力量，坚定地朝他选择的方向前进。
老人想，曾经因为我的背叛，他不得不做出选择。
他的选择是留在深邃黑暗的水域之中，远离所有陷阱和诡计。我的选择是去那里找到他，超出一切人类之上。现在我们被绑在一起，从中午开始就一直是这样。没有人可以帮助我们任何一方。
也许我不应该成为一个渔夫，他想。但那是我生来就该做的事情。我一定要记得等天亮后要吃那条金枪鱼。
在天亮之前的某个时候，有什么东西咬住了他身后的鱼饵。他听到木棍断裂声和渔线开始从船边飞速滑出。在黑暗中，他解开剑鞘刀，把所有的鱼拉力都承受在左肩，向后倾倒，用刀子在船舷的木头上割断了渔线。然后他割断了离他最近的另一条线，在黑暗中牢固地系好了备用线圈的末端。他只用一只手娴熟地操作着，把脚踩在线圈上以固定它们，同时把结扎得紧紧的。现在，他有六个备用线圈。有两个来自他切断的每个鱼饵，另外两个来自鱼吃掉的鱼饵，它们都相连。
天亮后，他想，我将回到四十法丈那个鱼饵，将它也割断并连接上备用线圈。我将损失两百法丈的好加泰兰鱼线、渔钩和浮漂器。这些都可以替换。但如果我钩到什么鱼然后它把他脱钩了，那谁来补偿这条鱼呢？
我不知道刚才咬鱼饵的那条鱼是什么鱼。可能是旗鱼、宽尾鱼还是鲨鱼。我从没感觉到它。我不得不太快地摆脱它。
他大声说：“我希望男孩在这里。”

[51] But you haven’t got the boy, he thought. You have only yourself and you had
better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and
hook up the two reserve coils.
So he did it. It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled
him down on his face and made a cut below his eye. The blood ran down his cheek a little
way. But it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to
the bow and rested against the wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line
so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his
shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of
the skiff through the water.
I wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought. The wire must have slipped on the
great hill of his back. Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does. But he cannot
pull this skiff forever, no matter how great he is. Now everything is cleared away that
might make trouble and I have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.
“Fish,” he said softly, aloud, “I’ll stay with you until I am dead.”
[52] He’ll stay with me too, I suppose, the old man thought and he waited for it to be
light. It was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be
warm. I can do it as long as he can, he thought. And in the first light the line extended out
and down into the water. The boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose
it was on the old man’s right shoulder.
“He’s headed north,” the old man said. The current will have set us far to the
eastward, he thought. I wish he would turn with the current. That would show that he
was tiring.
When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring.
There was only one favorable sign. The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a
lesser depth. That did not necessarily mean that he would jump. But he might.
“God let him jump,” the old man said. “I have enough line to handle him.”
Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he
thought. Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he’ll fill the sacks along his backbone
with air and then he cannot go deep to die.
[53] He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of
the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned
back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it. I must not jerk it ever, he
thought. Each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might
throw it. Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to look into it.
There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added
drag and he was pleased. It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much
phosphorescence in the night.
“Fish,” he said, “I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before
this day ends.”

[51] 但是你没有那个男孩，他想。你只有你自己，最好现在就回到最后一道线，无论是在黑暗中还是在黑暗中，把它割掉，挂上两个备用线圈。
于是他这样做了。在黑暗中很困难，有一次鱼突然向前冲，把他拉倒在地，眼睛下方被扯伤。血从脸颊往下流了一小段路。但在流到下巴之前就凝固干燥了，他艰难地回到船头，靠在木头上休息。他调整了袋子，小心地拉线，让它在肩膀的新部位上，并用肩膀锚定住它，小心地感受着鱼的拉力，然后用手感受着小船在水中的前进。
他想，他为什么会那样猛地一冲呢？铁丝一定在他厚实的背上滑动了。肯定他的背感觉不像我的这么糟糕。但无论他多伟大，也不能永远拉着这条小船。现在所有可能引起麻烦的都被清理干净了，我有足够长的线备用；这就是一个人所能要求的一切。
“鱼，”他低声说道，“我将陪伴你直到我死去。”
[52] 我想他也会陪伴着我，老人想着，他等着天亮。现在在天未亮的时候很冷，他靠在木头上取暖。我可以跟他一样撑得住，他想。在第一缕光线出现时，线延伸到水中。小船稳定地移动着，当太阳的第一抹光边升起时，正好照在老人的右肩上。
“他正向北游去，”老人说。海流会将我们带得很远，东边去了，他想。希望他能随着海流转向。那将表明他在疲倦。
太阳升得更高时，老人意识到鱼并没有疲倦。只有一个有利的征兆。线的倾斜显示他在游得更浅。这并不一定意味着他会跳出水面。但他可能会。
“上帝让他跳吧，”老人说。“我有足够长的线来应付他。”
也许我稍微加大张力，会让他疼，然后他会跳出来，他想。现在已经是白天了，让他跳，这样他会让背部的袋子充满气体，然后他就不能深入水中死去。
[53] 他试图增加张力，但自从他钩到鱼以来，线已经拉得紧绷到即将断裂的边缘，他感到强硬，当他往后倾拉时，他知道不能再施加更多的压力。我不能随意地拉动它，他想。每一次拉动都会扩大钩子划出的伤口，等他真的跳出水面时，它可能会脱落。不管怎样，有了太阳，我感觉更好了，这一次我不用对着阳光看了。
线上有黄色的海草，但老人知道那只会增加一种阻力，他感到高兴。夜间产生那么多发光的是黄色的海湾海草。
“鱼，”他说，“我非常爱戴你并且尊重你。但在今天结束之前，我会把你杀死。”

Let us hope so, he thought.
A small bird came toward the skiff from the north. He was a warbler and flying very
low over
the water. The old man could see that he was very tired. The bird made the stern of
the boat and rested there. Then he flew around the old man’s head and rested on the line
where he was more comfortable. “How old are you?” the old man asked the bird. “Is this
your first trip?”
[54] The bird looked at him when he spoke. He was too tired even to examine the
line and he teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast.
“It’s steady,” the old man told him. “It’s too steady. You shouldn’t be that tired after
a windless night. What are birds coming to?”
The hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them. But he said nothing of
this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the
hawks soon enough.
“Take a good rest, small bird,” he said. “Then go in and take your chance like any
man or bird or fish.”
It encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly
now.
“Stay at my house if you like, bird,” he said. “I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and
take you in with the small breeze that is rising. But I am with a friend.”
Just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow
and would have pulled him overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line.
The bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him
go. He felt the line [55] carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding.
“Something hurt him then,” he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he
could turn the fish. But when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and
settled back against the strain of the line.
“You’re feeling it now, fish,” he said. “And so, God knows, am I.”
He looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company.
The bird was gone.
You did not stay long, the man thought. But it is rougher where you are going until
you make the shore. How did I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made? I
must be getting very stupid. Or perhaps I was looking at the small bird and thinking of
him. Now I will pay attention to my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I will not
have a failure of strength.
“I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt,” he said aloud.

希望如此，他想。
一只小鸟从北方飞向小船。它是一只鸣禽，飞得非常低，几乎是贴着水面。老人看得出它很累。这只鸟飞到船艏边停下休息。然后绕着老人的头飞来飞去，在钓线上找到了一个更舒适的位置。老人问鸟：“你多大了？这是你第一次旅行吗？”
鸟在他说话时看了看他。它太疲倦了，甚至无法检查钓线，脆弱的脚勾紧了它。
“很平稳，”老人告诉它。“太平稳了。一个无风的夜晚后，你不应该这么疲惫。鸟都怎么了？”
他想到那些来海上迎接他们的老鹰。但他没对这只鸟说什么，反正它也听不懂他，而且很快就会知道关于老鹰的事。
“好好休息，小鸟，”他说。“然后进去，像任何人或鸟或鱼一样冒险。”
他觉得说话很鼓励，因为他的背在夜间已经僵硬了，现在真的很疼。
“如果你愿意，鸟，可以在我家住一晚，”他说。“很抱歉我不能张起帆，用微微起来的微风带你进去。但我有个朋友。”
就在那时，鱼突然猛地一拉，将老人拉向船头，如果他不支撑住，给予一些钓线，他差点被拉到水里去。当钓线一拉时，鸟已经飞走了，老人甚至都没看见。
他用右手仔细摸了摸钓线，发现自己的手在流血。
“一定是什么东西伤了它，”他大声说道，然后拉了一点钓线，看看是否能转动鱼。但当他接近断裂点时，他稳住了，顶住了钓线的拉力。
“你感受到了，鱼，”他说。“上帝知道，我也一样。”
他此时四处寻找那只鸟，因为他希望有个伴。但鸟已经不见了。
你没有待太久，老人想道。但是在你要去的地方比较艰难，直到你到达岸边。我怎么会让鱼在我身上割了下来呢？我一定变得非常愚蠢了，或者可能我是在看着那只小鸟并想着它。现在我要专心工作，然后我必须吃掉那条金枪鱼，这样我就不会体力不支了。
“我希望男孩在这里，还有些盐，”他大声说。

Shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed
his hand in the ocean and held it there, submerged, for more than a [56] minute watching
the blood trail away and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat
moved.
“He has slowed much,” he said.
The old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was
afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held
his hand up against the sun. It was only a line burn that had cut his flesh. But it was in
the working part of his hand. He knew he would need his hands before this was over and
he did not like to be cut before it started.
“Now,” he said, when his hand had dried, “I must eat the small tuna. I can reach him
with the gaff and eat him here in comfort.”
He knelt down and found the tuna under the stem with the gaff and drew it toward
him keeping it clear of the coiled lines. Holding the line with his left shoulder again, and
bracing on his left hand and arm, he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back
in place. He put one knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from
the back of the head to the tail. They were wedge-shaped strips and he cut [57] them from
next to the back bone down to the edge of the belly. When he had cut six strips he spread
them out on the wood of the bow, wiped his knife on his trousers, and lifted the carcass of
the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard.
“I don’t think I can eat an entire one,” he said and drew his knife across one of the
strips. He could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped. It
drew up tight on the heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust.
“What kind of a hand is that,” he said. “Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a
claw. It will do you no good.”
Come on, he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line.
Eat it now and it will strengthen the hand. It is not the hand’s fault and you have been
many hours with the fish. But you can stay with him forever. Eat the bonito now.
He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly. It was not
unpleasant.
Chew it well, he thought, and get all the juices. It would not be had to eat with a little
lime or with lemon or with salt.
“How do you feel, hand?” he asked the cramped [58] hand that was almost as stiff as
rigor mortis. “I’ll eat some more for you.”
He ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two. He chewed it carefully and
then spat out the skin.
“How does it go, hand? Or is it too early to know?”
He took another full piece and chewed it.

他将钓线的重量转移到左肩上，小心翼翼地跪了下来，他把手浸入海洋中，放了超过一分钟，看着血迹消失和水流稳定地对着手的移动，随着船的移动。
“它慢下来了许多。”他说。
老人本想让自己的手在咸水中浸泡更长一些，但他害怕鱼再次突然扯动，于是站起来，撑稳自己，将手举在太阳下面。只是一条线烧伤划破了他的肌肤。但这发生在他的手的工作部分。他知道在结束之前他会需要他的手，他不想在开始之前受伤。
“现在，”他说，当手干了以后，“我必须吃掉这条小金枪鱼。我可以用鱼叉钩住它，然后在这里舒适地吃掉它。”
他跪下来，在船头用鱼叉找到金枪鱼，并把它往自己身边拉，确保它远离盘绕排的钓线。再次将线挂在左肩上，用左手和手臂支撑，他从鱼叉钩上取下金枪鱼，然后重新放好鱼叉。他把一膝盖放在鱼身上，然后纵向从头部开始切下深红色的肉条。这些肉条呈楔形，他沿着脊椎旁边切下，直到腹部边缘。当他切了六条肉条后，他将它们铺在船头的木板上，用裤子擦拭了一下刀子，然后提着金枪鱼的尾巴将骨头扔到了海里。
“我想我吃不完一个，”他说着，然后用刀子切了一条肉条。他感觉到绳索的持续沉重拉扯，他的左手抽筋了。它紧绷在沉重的绳索上，他厌恶地看着它。
“这是怎样的一只手，”他说，“抽筋吧，如果你想的话。将自己变成一只爪子。这对你没有好处。”
他心里想着，然后往下看着斜着的绳索在黑暗的水中。现在吃吧，这样会加强手的力量。这不是手的错，你已经和这条鱼相处了很多小时。但你可以永远留在它身边。现在吃掉金枪鱼。
他拿起一块放进嘴里，慢慢地咀嚼着。味道并不难吃。
好好咀嚼，他想着，把所有的汁液都吃下去。加点酸橙汁或柠檬汁或盐，应该不难吃。
“你感觉怎么样，手？”他问那只几乎僵硬如同僵尸般的抽筋手。“我会再为你多吃一些。”
他吃掉了那块切成两半的另一部分。他仔细地咀嚼着，然后吐掉皮。
“手，感觉如何？还是现在知道还太早？”
他拿了另一整块，开始咀嚼。

“It is a strong full-blooded fish,” he thought. “I was lucky to get him instead of
dolphin. Dolphin is too sweet. This is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it.”
There is no sense in being anything but practical though, he thought. I wish I had
some salt. And I do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left, so I had better
eat it all although I am not hungry. The fish is calm and steady. I will eat it all and then I
will be ready.
“Be patient, hand,” he said. “I do this for you.”
I wish I could feed the fish, he thought. He is my brother. But I must kill him and
keep strong to do it. Slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedge-shaped strips of
fish.
He straightened up, wiping his hand on his trousers. “Now,” he said. “You can let the
cord go, hand, and I will handle him with the right arm alone until you [59] stop that
nonsense.” He put his left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back
against the pull against his back.
“God help me to have the cramp go,” he said. “Because I do not know what the fish is
going to do.”
But he seems calm, he thought, and following his plan. But what is his plan, he
thought. And what is mine? Mine I must improvise to his because of his great size. If he
will jump I can kill him. But he stays down forever. Then I will stay down with him
forever.
He rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers. But
it would not open. Maybe it will open with the sun, he thought. Maybe it will open when
the strong raw tuna is digested. If I have to have it, I will open it, cost whatever it costs.
But I do not want to open it now by force. Let it open by itself and come back of its own
accord. After all I abused it much in the night when it was necessary to free and untie the
various lines.
He looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now. But he could see the
prisms in the deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and the strange undulation
of the calm. The clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and
saw a [60] flight of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water, then
blurring, then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea.
He thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boar and
knew they were right in the months of sudden bad weather. But now they were in
hurricane months and, when there are no hurricanes, the weather of hurricane months is
the best of all the year.
If there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead, if you
are at sea. They do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for, he
thought. The land must make a difference too, in the shape of the clouds. But we have no
hurricane coming now.
He looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly piles of ice cream

“这是一条强壮、热血的鱼，”他想。“我很幸运能捕捉到它，而不是海豚。海豚太甜了。这条鱼几乎没有甜味，所有的力量都还在它身上。”
不过，只有实际才有意义，他想。我希望有些盐。我也不知道太阳会让剩下的鱼腐烂还是干燥，所以我最好把它全部吃完，尽管我并不饿。这条鱼很安静，很稳重。我会把它吃完，然后我就准备好了。
“耐心点，手，”他说。“我为了你才这样做。”
我希望我能喂这条鱼，他想。它是我的兄弟。但我必须杀了它，保持自己的力量。他慢慢而认真地吃下了鱼的楔形片。
他站起身，用裤子擦了擦手。“现在，”他说。“你可以松开绳子，手，我单靠右手就能处理它，直到你停止那无端的折磨。”他把左脚放在左手握住的厚绳上，向后倒在对抗背部的拉力上。
“上帝帮助我去抽筋，”他说。“因为我不知道这条鱼会怎么做。”
但他看起来很平静，他想，并按照他的计划行动。但他的计划是什么，他想。而我的呢？由于他体型庞大，我必须随机应变。如果它要跳，我可以杀死它。但它永远待在水下。那么我将永远待在水下。
他用僵硬的手抚摸裤子，试图轻轻拉开手指。但它不愿松开。也许太阳升起时会松开，他想。也许在消化强壮的新鲜金枪鱼时会松开。如果必须放弃，无论代价如何，我都将让它松开。但我不想现在强行打开它。让它自行打开，自己回来。毕竟在夜晚，为了释放和解开各种绳索，我对它折磨了很多。
他望向大海，意识到自己现在是多么孤独。但他能看到深邃黑暗的水中的棱柱，绵延前进的绳索和平静的奇特波动。云层正在聚集，预示着东北风的来临，他望着前方，看到一群野鸭在天空上划过，然后模糊不清，再次显露，他知道海上永远不会让人感到孤独。
他想起有些人恐惧在海面上看不见陆地，他们在突发恶劣天气的月份就对了。但现在是飓风月，而且，在没有飓风的时候，飓风月的天气是一年中最好的。
如果有飓风，你总能提前几天看到天空中的迹象，如果你在海上。他们不会在陆地上看到，因为他们不知道要寻找什么，他想。陆地上的云彩形状肯定也会不同。但现在我们没有飓风从远方来袭。
他抬头看着天空，看到白色堆积如友好的冰淇淋 -22 -

and high above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high September sky.
“Light brisa,” he said. “Better weather for me than for you, fish.”
His left hand was still cramped, but he was unknotting it slowly.
I hate a cramp, he thought. It is a treachery of one’s [61] own body. It is humiliating
before others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it. But a
cramp, he thought of it as a calambre, humiliates oneself especially when one is alone.
If the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm, he
thought. But it will loosen up.
Then, with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw
the slant change in the water. Then, as he leaned against the line and slapped his left
hand hard and fast against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.
“He’s coming up,” he said. “Come on hand. Please come on.”
The line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of
the boat and the fish came out. He came out unendingly and water poured from his sides.
He was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the
stripes on his sides showed wide and a light lavender. His sword was as long as a baseball
bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the water and then
re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the old [62] man saw the great scythe-blade of
his tail go under and the line commenced to race out.
“He is two feet longer than the skiff,” the old man said. The line was going out fast
but steadily and the fish was not panicked. The old man was trying with both hands to
keep the line just inside of breaking strength. He knew that if he could not slow the fish
with a steady pressure the fish could take out all the line and break it.
He is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought. I must never let him learn his
strength nor what he could do if he made his run. If I were him I would put in everything
now and go until something broke. But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who
kill them; although they are more noble and more able.
The old man had seen many great fish. He had seen many that weighed more than a
thousand pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life, but never alone. Now
alone, and out of sight of land, he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and
bigger than he had ever heard of, and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws
of an eagle.
[63] It will uncramp though, he thought. Surely it will uncramp to help my right
hand. There are three things that are brothers: the fish and my two hands. It must
uncramp. It is unworthy of it to be cramped. The fish had slowed again and was going at
his usual pace.
I wonder why he jumped, the old man thought. He jumped almost as though to show
me how big he was. I know now, anyway, he thought. I wish I could show him what sort

亚洲之行。高高在上，是岁月飘逸的薄羽毛，抵着九月高空。
“轻风习习，”他说。“对我来说是好天气，对你这条鱼来说却不一样。”
他的左手依然抽筋，但他慢慢地在解开。
他讨厌抽筋，他想。这是身体的背叛。在他人面前，因为食物中毒一次腹泻或呕吐是很羞耻的。但抽筋，他把它看作是一种羞辱，尤其当一个人独自一人时。
如果男孩在这里，他可以为我揉搓，松开我的前臂，他想。但它会自己解开的。
然后，他用右手感受到了线的牵引力的变化，然后看到了水面倾斜的变化。然后，当他倚在线上，用左手猛烈拍打大腿时，他看到线缓缓向上倾斜。
“它将会浮出水面，”他说。“快点啊，手。请快点。”
线缓慢而稳定地上升，然后海洋的表面隆起，鱼跑了出来。它永无止尽地游出水面，水从它的两侧流下。它在阳光下闪耀，头和背都是深紫色的，在阳光下，它身体的条纹宽宽的，呈浅紫色。它的剑像一根棒球棍一样长，锋利如细剑，它全身从水中伸出来，然后又平稳地再次进入水中，就像一个潜水员，老人看到它巨大的尾巴刀锋下沉，线出现开始飞奔的迹象。
“它比渔篓还长两英尺，”老人说道。线很快地飞出去，但鱼并没有惊慌。老人用双手努力让线保持在破裂强度的范围内。他知道如果不能通过稳定的压力减慢鱼的速度，鱼会把所有的线拉出来，然后断掉。
“它是一条大鱼，我必须说服它，”他想。我决不能让它意识到自己的力量，也不能让它知道如果一直顶到底会发生什么。如果我是它，我会现在就全力以赴，直到有什么东西断裂为止。但万幸的是，他们并不像我们这样杀死它们的人那样聪明；尽管它们更高贵，更有能力。
老人见过很多巨大的鱼。他见过很多超过一千磅的鱼，他一生中捕获过两条这样大的鱼，但都不是一个人。现在，独自一人，远离陆地，他绑住了自己一生中见过的最大的鱼，大到超过他听说过的最大的鱼，而且他的左手依然像鹰爪一样紧紧地抓着。
它会松开的，他想。它肯定会松开，以帮助我的右手。有三样东西是兄弟：这条鱼和我的两只手。它肯定会松开。它抽筋是不值得的。那条鱼又慢了下来，以它通常的速度前进。
老人想，我不知道为什么它跃出水面。它跃得几乎是想要向我展示它有多大。不过我现在明白了，他想。我希望我能向它展示我是什么样的人。但那样的话它会看到我抽筋的手。让它认为我是更有男子气概的，不然会有点难为情。

than I am and I will be so. I wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has
against only my will and my intelligence.
He settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the
fish swam steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water. There was a small
sea rising with the wind coming up from the east and at noon the old man’s left hand was
uncramped.
“Bad news for you, fish,” he said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his
shoulders.
He was comfortable but suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all.
“I am not religious,” he said. “But I will say ten Our [64] Fathers and ten Hail Marys
that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Cobre if I
catch him. That is a promise.”
He commenced to say his prayers mechanically. Sometimes he would be so tired that
he could not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would
come automatically. Hail Marys are easier to say than Our Fathers, he thought.
“Hail Mary full of Grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.” Then he added, “Blessed Virgin, pray for the
death of this fish. Wonderful though he is.”
With his prayers said, and feeling much better, but suffering exactly as much, and
perhaps a little more, he leaned against the wood of the bow and began, mechanically, to
work the fingers of his left hand.
The sun was hot now although the breeze was rising gently.
“I had better re-bait that little line out over the stern,” he said. “If the fish decides to
stay another night I will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottle. I don’t think
I can get anything but a dolphin [65] here. But if I eat him fresh enough he won’t be bad.
I wish a flying fish would come on board tonight. But I have no light to attract them. A
flying fish is excellent to eat raw and I would not have to cut him up. I must save all my
strength now. Christ, I did not know he was so big.”
“I’ll kill him though,” he said. “In all his greatness and his glory.”
Although it is unjust, he thought. But I will show him what a man can do and what a
man endures.
“I told the boy I was a strange old man,” he said.
“Now is when I must prove it.”
The thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing. Now he was proving it
again. Each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing
it.

比我年轻，我也会变得如此。他心想，但愿我是那条鱼，他拼尽全力对抗我只有我的意志和智慧。

他舒适地靠在木头上，接受着痛苦，鱼不停地游动，小船缓慢地在黑暗的水面上移动。随着从东方吹来的风，海面波浪渐起，到中午时老人左手不再抽筋。

“对你来说是个坏消息，鱼，”他说着，把鱼线挪到覆盖肩膀的帆布上。

尽管他感到舒适但也在受苦，他却没有承认自己受苦。
“我不信教，”他说，“但我发誓念十个天主经和十个圣母经来捕捉这条鱼，如果我捕到了，我愿意朝圣科布雷圣母。这是诺言。”

他开始机械地念起祈祷。有时候他太累了以至于记不住祷文，于是他会快速地念，让它们变得自动化。他觉得念圣母经比念天主经容易。
“圣母玛利亚，充满恩宠，主与你同在。你在妇女中受祝福，你腹中所生的耶稣同样受祝福。圣母玛利亚，天主之母，请为我们这些罪人祈求，现在和我们临终时。阿门。”他接着说，“圣母，为这条鱼的死祈祷吧。尽管他很了不起。”

祷告说完后，感觉好多了，但受苦却一样，甚至更多，他靠在船头的木头上，机械地开始活动左手的手指。

太阳现在很热，尽管微风正渐渐起来。
“我最好重新把那条小鱼线放到船尾去，”他说，“如果鱼决定再待一晚，我就需要再吃点东西了，水瓶里的水也快见底了。我想这里除了海豚外别无他鱼了。但如果我足够快吃上新鲜的他，他就不会变坏。但愿今晚有飞鱼跳上船来。但我没有灯光吸引它们。飞鱼生吃非常美味，我还不用切开它。我现在必须节约所有的力气。天啊，我不知道它有这么大。”

“尽管这是不公正的，”他想，“但我会让他看看一个人能做什么，也能忍受什么。”

“我告诉那孩子我是个古怪的老人，”他说。
“现在我必须证明。”

他已经证明过一千次了的事实一点都不重要。现在他又在证明一次。每一次都是全新的经历，他从不在做的时候想着过去。

I wish he’d sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought. Why are
the lions the main thing that is left? Don’t think, old man, he said to himself, Rest gently
now against the wood and think of nothing. He is working. Work as little as you can.
It was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily. But
there was an added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man [66] rode gently
with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and
smoothly.
Once in the afternoon the line started to rise again. But the fish only continued to
swim at a slightly higher level. The sun was on the old man’s left arm and shoulder and
on his back. So he knew the fish had turned east of north.
Now that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming in the water
with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the
dark. I wonder how much he sees at that depth, the old man thought. His eye is huge and
a horse, with much less eye, can see in the dark. Once I could see quite well in the dark.
Not in the absolute dark. But almost as a cat sees.
The sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now
completely and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of
his back to shift the hurt of the cord a little.
“If you’re not tired, fish,” he said aloud, “you must be very strange.”
He felt very tired now and he knew the night would come soon and he tried to think
of other things. He thought of the Big Leagues, to him they were the Gran [67] Ligas, and
he knew that the Yankees of New York were playing the Tigres of Detroit.
This is the second day now that I do not know the result of the juegos, he thought.
But I must have confidence and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all
things perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel. What is a bone spur? he
asked himself. Un espuela de hueso. We do not have them. Can it be as painful as the
spur of a fighting cock in one’s heel? I do not think I could endure that or the loss of the
eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks do. Man is not much
beside the great birds and beasts. Still I would rather be that beast down there in the
darkness of the sea.
“Unless sharks come,” he said aloud. “If sharks come, God pity him and me.”
Do you believe the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I will stay with
this one? he thought. I am sure he would and more since he is young and strong. Also his
father was a fisherman. But would the bone spur hurt him too much?
“I do not know,” he said aloud. “I never had a bone spur.”
As the sun set he remembered, to give himself more [68] confidence, the time in the
tavern at Casablanca when he had played the hand game with the great negro from
Cienfuegos who was the strongest man on the docks. They had gone one day and one
night with their elbows on a chalk line on the table and their forearms straight up and
their hands gripped tight. Each one was trying to force the other’s hand down onto the

他希望他能睡觉，我也能睡觉，梦见关于狮子的梦，他想。为什么狮子是唯一还留在他心中的东西？不要思考，老人，他对自己说，轻轻地靠在木头上，什么都不要想。他在努力工作。尽量少工作。

下午已经过去，小船依然慢慢均匀地前进。但现在有一种从东风吹来的阻力，老人轻轻地随着小海浪前行，背上的绳子带来的疼痛轻而易举地到达了他的身体。

下午的某个时候，鱼线又开始上升了。但鱼只是继续在稍高一点的水平游动。太阳照在老人的左臂和肩膀上，温暖在他的背上。所以他知道鱼已经转向东北。

现在他已经看见鱼一次，他可以想象鱼在水中游动，他那紫色的胸鳍和笔直的大尾巴划过黑暗的水面。老人想，他在那样深的水下能看见多少东西呢？他的眼睛很大，一匹马，长着更小的眼睛，都能在黑暗中看见。我曾经在黑暗中看得很清楚。并不是在绝对的黑暗中。但几乎像猫一样看得清楚。

太阳和他手指的稳定移动已经完全解放了他左手的抽筋，他开始更多地转移压力到它上面，然后缩肩撑背，稍微减轻了绳索的疼痛。

“如果你不累，鱼儿，”他大声说道，“你一定很奇怪。”

他现在感到非常疲倦，他知道夜晚即将到来，他尽力想着其他事情。他想着大联盟，对他来说，它们是Gran Ligas，他知道纽约的洋基队正在与底特律的虎队比赛。

这已经是第二天了，我不知道比赛结果，他想。但我必须保持信心，我必须值得做到所有事情都完美的伟大迪马吉奥，即使他的脚后跟有骨刺也能做到。什么是骨刺呢？他问自己。Un espuela de hueso。我们这里没有。这会和鸟跟鸽战士脚后跟的刺一样疼吗？我不觉得我能忍受那样的疼痛，或者失去一只眼睛，失去两只眼睛，仍然像战斗鸽一样战斗。人类与伟大鸟类和野兽相比很微不足道。但是我宁愿成为海底黑暗中的那只野兽。

“除非有鲨鱼过来，”他大声说道。“如果有鲨鱼过来，愿上帝怜悯他和我。”

你认为伟大的迪马吉奥会像我会和这条鱼待在一起这么久吗？他想。我敢肯定他会，而且更多，因为他年轻又强壮。而且他的父亲是渔夫。但骨刺会让他感到太疼吗？

“我不知道，”他大声说道。“我从来没有骨刺。”

太阳落下时，他想起了自己在卡萨布兰卡酒馆与那位来自西恩富戈斯的大黑人玩手腕比赛的时候，用以给自己更多的信心。他是码头上最强壮的男人。他们当时用手肘放在桌子上的粉笔线上，前臂挺直，双手紧紧握住。每个人都试图迫使对方的手按到桌子上。

table. There was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the
kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negro’s
face. They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees
could sleep. Blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negro’s hands
and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors
went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched. The
walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows
against them. The negro’s shadow was huge and it moved on the wall as the breeze
moved the lamps.
The odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and
lighted cigarettes for him.
Then the negro, after the rum, would try for a tremendous [69] effort and once he
had the old man, who was not an old man then but was Santiago El Campeon, nearly
three inches off balance. But the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again. He
was sure then that he had the negro, who was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten. And
at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be called a draw and the referee was
shaking his head, he had unleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and
down until it rested on the wood. The match had started on a Sunday morning and ended
on a Monday morning. Many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they had to go
to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the Havana Coal Company. Otherwise
everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish. But he had finished it anyway and before
anyone had to go to work.
For a long time after that everyone had called him The Champion and there had
been a return match in the spring. But not much money was bet and he had won it quite
easily since he had broken the confidence of the negro from Cienfuegos in the first match.
After that he had a few matches and then no more. He decided that he could beat anyone
if he wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was bad for his right [70] hand for
fishing. He had tried a few practice matches with his left hand. But his left hand had
always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it to do and he did not trust it.
The sun will bake it out well now, he thought. It should not cramp on me again
unless it gets too cold in the night. I wonder what this night will bring.
An airplane passed overhead on its course to Miami and he watched its shadow
scaring up the schools of flying fish.
“With so much flying fish there should be dolphin,” he said, and leaned back on the
line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish. But he could not and it stayed at the
hardness and water-drop shivering that preceded breaking. The boat moved ahead slowly
and he watched the airplane until he could no longer see it.
It must be very strange in an airplane, he thought. I wonder what the sea looks like
from that height? They should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high. I
would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above. In
the turtle boats I was in the cross-trees of the mast-head and even at that height I saw
much. The dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripes and their purple

桌面。人们在煤油灯下进出房间，进行了许多赌注，他看着黑人的手臂和手以及黑人的脸。每隔八个小时之后，裁判就会更换，以便裁判能休息。他和黑人的手指底下都冒着血，他们互相对视，看着彼此的眼睛、手和前臂，赌徒进进出出房间，坐在墙边的高椅上观看。墙壁刷成了亮蓝色，是木质的，灯光投射在墙壁上形成影子。黑人的影子很大，随着微风摆动着灯。

整夜的赔率一直在来回变化，他们给黑人喂养朗姆酒，点燃香烟给他。

然后在喝了朗姆酒后，黑人试图用巨大的力气进行一次尝试，有一次他将那时还不是老人而是圣地亚哥·埃尔·坎皮昂几乎使其三英寸失去平衡。但老人举起手，重新恢复到平衡。他确信他已经打败了黑人，他是一位出色的人和伟大的运动员。天亮时，赌徒们要求将比赛称为平局，裁判摇了摇头，然后他发起进攻，将黑人的手向下压，直到手停在木头上。这场比赛从一个星期天早晨开始，到一个星期一早晨结束。许多赌徒要求平局，因为他们得去码头工作，装载糖袋或者在哈瓦那煤炭公司工作。否则每个人都会希望比赛进行到底。但无论如何，他总要结束比赛，在任何人去工作之前。

很长一段时间后，每个人都称他为冠军，并在春季进行了一场回归赛。但下注的金额不多，他轻松赢得了比赛，因为他在第一场比赛中打破了那位来自Cienfuegos的黑人的信心。之后他参加了几场比赛，然后再没有比赛了。他决定只要他足够想要，就可以战胜任何人，也发现这对他的右手钓鱼不利。他用左手进行了几场训练比赛。但他的左手一直是背信弃义的，不按照他所要求的去; 做，他不信任它。
太阳会把它晾干的，他想。除非夜晚变得太冷，否则不会再抽筋了。我想知道今晚会发生什么。

一架飞机掠过头顶飞往迈阿密，他看着它的影子，吓跑了飞鱼群。

“有这么多飞鱼，应该会有海豚，”他说，向后倾靠在钓线上，看是否可能追上他的鱼。但他做不到，鱼保持着坚硬和滴水的颤抖，预示着它即将折断。小船缓慢前进，他看着飞机，直到看不见它为止。

坐在飞机里一定很奇怪吧，他想。我想知道从那个高度看大海是什么样子的？如果他们不飞得太高，他们应该能很好地看到鱼。我想缓缓地飞行，高出两百浔，从上面看鱼。我曾经在海龟船的桅顶上，甚至在那个高度，我也能看到很多。海豚从那里看起来更绿，你可以看到他们的条纹和他们的紫色。

[71] spots and you can see all of the school as they swim. Why is it that all the fast-moving
fish of the dark current have purple backs and usually purple stripes or spots? The
dolphin looks green of course because he is really golden. But when he comes to feed,
truly hungry, purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin. Can it be anger, or the
greater speed he makes that brings them out?
Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved
and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a
yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in
the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. It
jumped again and again in the acrobatics of its fear and he worked his way back to the
stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and arm, he pulled the
dolphin in with his left hand, stepping on the gained line each time with his bare left foot.
When the fish was at the stem, plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation, the
old man leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish with its purple spots over
the stem. Its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites against [72] the hook and it
pounded the bottom of the skiff with its long flat body, its tail and its head until he
clubbed it across the shining golden head until it shivered and was still.
The old man unhooked the fish, re-baited the line with another sardine and tossed it
over. Then he worked his way slowly back to the bow. He washed his left hand and wiped
it on his trousers. Then he shifted the heavy line from his right hand to his left and
washed his right hand in the sea while he watched the sun go into the ocean and the slant
of the big cord.
“He hasn’t changed at all,” he said. But watching the movement of the water against
his hand he noted that it was perceptibly slower.
“I’ll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night,”
he said. “He’s good for the night and so am I.”
It would be better to gut the dolphin a little later to save the blood in the meat, he
thought. I can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time. I
had better keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset. The setting of
the sun is a difficult time for all fish. He let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line
[73] with it and eased himself as much as he could and allowed himself to be pulled
forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as much, or more, than he did.
I’m learning how to do it, he thought. This part of it anyway. Then too, remember he
hasn’t eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food. I have eaten the
whole bonito. Tomorrow I will eat the dolphin. He called it dorado. Perhaps I should eat
some of it when I clean it. It will be harder to eat than the bonito. But, then, nothing is
easy.
“How do you feel, fish?” he asked aloud. “I feel good and my left hand is better and I
have food for a night and a day. Pull the boat, fish.”
He did not truly feel good because the pain from the cord across his back had almost
passed pain and gone into a dullness that he mistrusted. But I have had worse things
than that, he thought. My hand is only cut a little and the cramp is gone from the other.

鱼群中有71条褐色条纹和你能看到所有的学校他们游泳。为什么所有快速移动的鱼在深色水流中都有紫色背部，通常有紫色条纹或斑点？海豚看起来当然是绿色的，因为他实际上是金色的。但是当它来吃东西时，真的饥饿了，紫色条纹显示在它的身体侧面上，就像旗鱼一样。这是因为愤怒或它增加的速度引起的吗？
就在天黑之前，当他们通过一个巨大的海葵岛时，它在光明的海上摇摆，好像海洋正在与黄色毯子下的某物做爱，他的小鱼线被一只海豚拉走了。当海豚在空中跳跃时，他首先看到了它，它在最后的太阳中显得真正金光闪闪，在空中弯曲和狂烈地拍打着。它一次又一次地进行着惊恐的杂技表演，而他则朝船尾爬去，蹲下并用右手和手臂握住大绳，用左手拉着海豚，每踩一次获得的线用赤脚的左脚跨在上面。当鱼处于船舷时，在绝望中来回拔出时，老人俯身在船舷上，将带有紫色斑点的金光灿烂的鱼提了起来。它的下颌在快速地咬着鱼钩，它用长长的扁平身体、尾巴和头部猛击着船底，直到他用金色闪闪的头猛击它，直到它颤抖不动。
老人解开了鱼，用另一条沙丁鱼重新上饵，然后慢慢地回到船头。他洗了左手，擦在裤子上。然后他把沉重的绳子从右手移到左手，在大海中洗了右手，看着太阳落入大海和大绳的倾斜。
"他一点也没变，"他说。但看着水对他手的运动，他注意到水流明显变慢了。
“我会把两条桨绑在船尾，这会让他在夜间慢下来，”他说。“他能撑过夜，我也一样。”
他想稍后剖开海豚，保存肉中的血液。我稍后可以做这件事，并把桨绑在一起同时制造阻力。现在最好让鱼保持安静，不在日落时扰乱它太多。太阳落山对所有鱼来说都是困难的时刻。他让手在空气中晾干，然后用手抓住绳线，尽量放松自己，并允许自己被拉向木头，这样船会承担更多的压力，或者说比他更多。
“我学会了如何做了，”他想。至少这其中一部分。还有，记住他自从上钩以来就没有吃东西了，而且他巨大而需要大量食物。我吃了整条金枪鱼。明天我会吃那只海豚。他称之为多拉多。也许我应该在清洁时吃一些。这会比吃金枪鱼更难。但是，没有一件事是容易的。
“你感觉如何，鱼？他大声问道。“我感觉很好，我的左手感觉更好了，我有一晚一天的食物。拉船，鱼。”
他并没有真正感觉良好，因为他背上的划痕疼痛几乎消失了，并变得麻木，使他感到不安。但是我经历过比这更糟糕的事情，他想。我只是手上破了点皮，另一只手的抽筋也消失了。

My legs are all right. Also now I have gained on him in the question of sustenance.
It was dark now as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in September. He lay
against the worn wood of the bow and rested all that he could. The first stars [74] were
out. He did not know the name of Rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out
and he would have all his distant friends.
“The fish is my friend too,” he said aloud. “I have never seen or heard of such a fish.
But I must kill him. I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars.”
Imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought. The moon runs
away. But imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun? We were born
lucky, he thought.
Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to
kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. How many people will he feed, he thought.
But are they worthy to eat him? No, of course not. There is no one worthy of eating him
from the manner of his behaviour and his great dignity.
I do not understand these things, he thought. But it is good that we do not have to
try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars. It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true
brothers.
Now, he thought, I must think about the drag. It has its perils and its merits. I may
lose so much line that I will lose him, if he makes his effort and the drag [75] made by the
oars is in place and the boat loses all her lightness. Her lightness prolongs both our
suffering but it is my safety since he has great speed that he has never yet employed. No
matter what passes I must gut the dolphin so he does not spoil and eat some of him to be
strong.
Now I will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady before I move back
to the stern to do the work and make the decision. In the meantime I can see how he acts
and if he shows any changes. The oars are a good trick; but it has reached the time to play
for safety. He is much fish still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth
and he has kept his mouth tight shut. The punishment of the hook is nothing. The
punishment of hunger, and that he is against something that he does not comprehend, is
everything. Rest now, old man, and let him work until your next duty comes.
He rested for what he believed to be two hours. The moon did not rise now until late
and he had no way of judging the time. Nor was he really resting except comparatively.
He was still bearing the pull of the fish across his shoulders but he placed his left hand on
the [76] gunwale of the bow and confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to
the skiff itself.
How simple it would be if I could make the line fast, he thought. But with one small
lurch he could break it. I must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all times
be ready to give line with both hands.
“But you have not slept yet, old man,” he said aloud. “It is half a day and a night and
now another day and you have not slept. You must devise a way so that you sleep a little if

我的腿好了。现在在食物的问题上，我也已经赶上他了。
现在天色已经很暗，因为九月的太阳落下后很快就会变暗。他靠在船头磨损的木头上，尽可能地休息。第一颗星星出现了。他不知道“参宿一”这个名字，但他看到了，知道很快整个星星都会出现，他将和他所有的远方朋友相遇。
“这条鱼也是我的朋友，”他大声说道。“我从未见过，也从未听说过有这样的一条鱼。但我必须杀死他。我庆幸我们不必试图去杀死星星。”
他想象，如果每天一个人必须试图去杀死月亮，月亮会逃走。但想象一下，如果每天一个人都必须试图去杀死太阳呢？我们出生在幸运之中，他想。
然后他为这条没得吃的大鱼感到难过，他对要杀死它的决心在他对它的遗憾中从未减弱。他想着，它能喂多少人呢？但他们配得上吗？当然不配。没有任何人是值得吃掉他的，从他的行为方式和他的伟大尊严来看。
我不明白这些事情，他想。但我们不必试图去杀死太阳、月亮或星星实在太好了。住在海上并杀死我们真正的兄弟已经足够。
现在，他想，我必须考虑拖。它有危险，也有好处。如果在使用桨划引起的拖中，船失去了轻快，我可能会丢掉足够的线，使我失去他。她的轻快延长了我们的痛苦，但对我来说是安全的，因为他有从未用过的极速。无论发生什么，我必须准备好拆掉海豚，以免它腐烂，然后吃些让自己强壮。
现在我将再休息一个小时，确保他已坚固稳定后再回到船尾进行工作和做决定。在此期间，我可以看看他的反应，看他有没有任何变化。桨是个好招数；但是现在已到了为了安全而出动的时候。他还是一条大鱼，我看到鱼钩就在他嘴角，他一直咬得很紧。鱼钩的惩罚并不严重。饥饿的惩罚，以及他对某种他无法理解的东西的反对，才是最重要的。现在休息吧，老人，让他工作直到你下一项职责来临。
他休息了他认为事两个小时。月亮现在升起得比较晚，他无法判断时间。但实际上，他并没有真正休息。他仍然忍受着鱼在他肩头上的拉扯，但他将左手放在船头的舷边上，越来越多地把对鱼的抵抗交给了小船本身。
如果我能把线牢固固定，那该多简单啊，他想。但只需要一次轻微的摇动，就会把它断掉。我必须用我的身体缓冲线的拉力，并随时左右手都准备给线。
“但你还没睡呢，老人，”他大声说道。“已经半昼夜，又过了一天，你还没睡。你必须想办法让自己稍微休息一下，如果- 28 -

he is quiet and steady. If you do not sleep you might become unclear in the head.”
I’m clear enough in the head, he thought. Too clear. I am as clear as the stars that are
my brothers. Still I must sleep. They sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the
ocean sleeps sometimes on certain days when there is no current and a flat calm.
But remember to sleep, he thought. Make yourself do it and devise some simple and
sure way about the lines. Now go back and prepare the dolphin. It is too dangerous to rig
the oars as a drag if you must sleep.
I could go without sleeping, he told himself. But it would be too dangerous.
[77] He started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees, being
careful not to jerk against the fish. He may be half asleep himself, he thought. But I do
not want him to rest. He must pull until he dies.
Back in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of the line across his
shoulders and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand. The stars were bright
now and he saw the dolphin clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head
and drew him out from under the stern. He put one of his feet on the fish and slit him
quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower jaw. Then he put his knife down and
gutted him with his right hand, scooping him clean and pulling the gills clear.
He felt the maw heavy and slippery in his hands and he slit it open. There were two
flying fish inside. They were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped
the guts and the gills over the stern. They sank leaving a trail of phosphorescence in the
water. The dolphin was cold and a leprous gray-white now in the starlight and the old
man skinned one side of him while he held his right foot on the fish’s head. Then he
turned him over and skinned the other side and cut each side off from the head down to
the tail.
[78] He slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the
water. But there was only the light of its slow descent. He turned then and placed the two
flying fish inside the two fillets of fish and putting his knife back in its sheath, he worked
his way slowly back to the bow. His back was bent with the weight of the line across it and
he carried the fish in his right hand.
Back in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish
beside them. After that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it
again with his left hand resting on the gunwale. Then he leaned over the side and washed
the flying fish in the water, noting the speed of the water against his hand. His hand was
phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he watched the flow of the water against it.
The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking of the
skiff, particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern.
“He is tiring or he is resting,” the old man said. “Now let me get through the eating of
this dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep.”
Under the stars and with the night colder all the [79] time he ate half of one of the
dolphin fillets and one of the flying fish, gutted and with its head cut off.

他安静而坚定。如果你不睡觉，可能会头脑不清。”
我头脑很清楚，他想。太清楚了。我和星星一样清晰，他们是我的兄弟。但我还是得睡觉。它们睡觉，月亮和太阳也睡觉，甚至海洋有时也会在没有洋流和风平浪静的一些日子里睡觉。
但记得要睡觉，他想。让自己睡，想出一种简单而可靠的方法来处理鱼线。现在回去准备海豚。如果你必须睡觉，把桨架起来作为拖曳是太危险了。
我可以不睡觉，他告诉自己。但那太危险了。
他开始用手膝走回船尾，小心翼翼地不要撞到鱼。他可能自己也半睡半醒了，他想。但我不希望他休息。他必须一直吃力直至死去。
回到船尾，他转过身来，左手承受住肩头鱼线的紧张，右手从剑鞘中拔出刀。星星现在很明亮，他清楚地看见了海豚，他将刀锋刺入海豚头部，从船尾下面拉出来。他把一只脚放在鱼身上，迅速地把鱼腹部切开，直到下巴尖。然后他将刀放下，用右手取出内脏，清理并拉出鱼腮。
他感觉到手中的鱼腹沉重而滑腻，他将其切开。里面有两条飞鱼。它们新鲜而坚硬，他将它们并排放在一起，将内脏和鳃扔到船尾。它们下沉时在水面留下一条磷光的尾迹。海豚现在在星光下变得冷冷的、灰白的，老人一边把他的一侧剥皮，一边用右脚踩住鱼头。然后他把鱼翻过来，剥掉另一侧，从头到尾切下每一条。
他将尸体推到船外，看看水中有没有漩涡。但只有它慢慢下沉的光。然后他转过身，将两条飞鱼放在两条鱼片中，把刀放回剑鞘里，慢慢走回船首。他的背因承受鱼线的重量而弯曲，右手拿着鱼。
回到船头，他将两条鱼片排在木头上，旁边是两条飞鱼。然后他将鱼线重新放在肩上的一个新位置，用左手靠在船边上重新拿起鱼线。然后他俯身倾身蘸水，注意水流对他手的速度。他的手因剥皮而发着磷光，他看着水流流过手。水流变弱了，当他用手边的一侧摩擦船的舷板时，磷光慢慢漂流到舷后。
“他很累了还是在休息，”老人说。“现在让我吃掉这条海豚，稍作休息，再睡一会儿。”
在星星下冉冉升起的冷夜中，他吃了半条海豚鱼片和一条飞鱼，剖开并切掉头部。

“What an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked,” he said. “And what a miserable fish
raw. I will never go in a boat again without salt or limes.”
If I had brains I would have splashed water on the bow all day and drying, it would
have made salt, he thought. But then I did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset. Still
it was a lack of preparation. But I have chewed it all well and I am not nauseated.
The sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were
gone. It looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and the wind
had dropped.
“There will be bad weather in three or four days,” he said. “But not tonight and not
tomorrow. Rig now to get some sleep, old man, while the fish is calm and steady.”
He held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh against his right
hand as he leaned all his weight against the wood of the bow. Then he passed the line a
little lower on his shoulders and braced his left hand on it.
My right hand can hold it as long as it is braced, he [80] thought If it relaxes in sleep
my left hand will wake me as the line goes out. It is hard on the right hand. But he is used
to punishment Even if I sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good. He lay forward
cramping himself against the line with all of his body, putting all his weight onto his right
band, and he was asleep.
He did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises that stretched
for eight or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating and they would leap high into
the air and return into the same hole they had made in the water when they leaped.
Then he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther and
he was very cold and his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of
a pillow.
After that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the
lions come down onto it in the early dark and then the other lions came and he rested his
chin on the wood of the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore
breeze and he waited to see if there would be more lions and he was happy.
The moon had been up for a long time but he slept [81] on and the fish pulled on
steadily and the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds.
He woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning
out through his right hand. He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could
with his right and the line rushed out. Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned
back against the line and now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left hand was
taking all the strain and cutting badly. He looked back at the coils of line and they were
feeding smoothly. Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean and
then a heavy fall. Then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although
line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to breaking point and
raising it to breaking point again and again. He had been pulled down tight onto the bow
and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move.

“鲜熟海豚是多么美味啊，”他说，“生着吃多么难吃。以后再也不会离开船只没带盐或酸橙了。”
他想，“如果我聪明点，整天泼水在船头，晾干后就会变成盐。”可是直到日落前他才勾到海豚。还是准备不足。但我嚼得很细，没有恶心的感觉。
天空朝东边铺满云彩，他熟知的星星一个接一个消失了。现在看起来他仿佛正在穿过一道巨大的云峡，风也停了下来。
“三四天后会有恶劣的天气，”他说，“但不是今晚也不是明天。现在快去睡一会儿吧，老人，鱼还在保持镇定。”
他用右手紧紧地拉着钓线，然后将右手大腿靠在船头木材上，全身的重量都倚在上面。然后他将线稍微往下放在肩膀上，用左手使劲支撑着。
只要我的右手还在支撑，它能撑住，他想，如果它在睡梦中放松下来，我的左手会在钓线被拉出时唤醒我。这对右手来说很难受，但它习惯了这种折磨。即使我只睡二十分钟或半个小时也是好的。他前倾着，全身的力量都用来紧贴着钓线，将所有的重量都压在右手上，他睡着了。
他没有梦见狮子，而是梦见了一群广阔的海豚，它们延伸了八到十英里，正值交配季节，它们会高高跃出水面，回到它们跃出水面时所造成的孔中。
接着他梦见自己身处村庄的床上，北风呼呼地吹着，他感到非常冷，右臂麻木了，因为他的头枕在上面，而不是靠着枕头。
之后他开始梦见那片长长的黄色海滩，看到第一只狮子在深夜踏上海滩，其他狮子也陆续走下来，他将下巴靠在停泊在港口的船头的木材上，感受着夜晚的离岸微风，等待着是否还会有更多的狮子，他感到幸福。
月亮已经高悬多时，但他却依然睡着，鱼在持续拉扯船只，船只穿过了云隧道。
他突然惊醒，右拳猛地撞向脸，钓线从右手间迅速滑出。他左手已经失去了感觉，但尽力用右手刹住，钓线却继续飞出。最终左手找到了钓线，他将身体往后靠在钓线上，现在钓线烧伤了他的背和左手，左手承受着所有的拉力，被割伤了。他回头看着一圈圈的钓线顺畅地传送着。就在那时，鱼突然跃出海面，海洋爆发出巨大的声音，然后重重地坠落。接着又跃起，船只移动得很快，尽管钓线仍在飞出，老人将拉力加到了极限，一次又一次。他紧贴着船头，脸贴在海豚片上，无法动弹。

This is what we waited for, he thought. So now let us take it. Make him pay for the
line, he thought. Make him pay for it.
He could not see the fish’s jumps but only heard the [82] breaking of the ocean and
the heavy splash as he fell. The speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had
always known this would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused
parts and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the fingers.
If the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought. Yes. If the boy were
here. If the boy were here.
The line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish
earn each inch of it. Now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish
that his cheek had crushed. Then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet.
He was ceding line but more slowly all he time. He worked back to where he could feel
with his foot the coils of line that he could not see. There was plenty of line still and now
the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water.
Yes, he thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the
sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring
him up. He will start circling soon and then I must work on him. I wonder what started
him so suddenly? Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, [83] or was he
frightened by something in the night? Maybe he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a
calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident. It is strange.
“You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,” he said. “You’re holding
him again but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle.”
The old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and stooped down
and scooped up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face. He
was afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength. When
his face was cleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side and then let it
stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise. He’s
headed almost east, he thought. That means he is tired and going with the current. Soon
he will have to circle. Then our true work begins.
After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out
and looked at it.
“It is not bad,” he said. “And pain does not matter to a man.”
He took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts
and shifted his weight [84] so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other
side of the skiff.
“You did not do so badly for something worthless,” he said to his left hand. “But
there was a moment when I could not find you.”
Why was I not born with two good hands? he thought. Perhaps it was my fault in not
training that one properly. But God knows he has had enough chances to learn. He did
not do so badly in the night, though, and he has only cramped once. If he cramps again

他看不见鱼跳，只能听到海洋的声响和他跌落时的重重一声。钓线的速度把他的手割得很厉害，但他一直知道这种情况会发生，他努力让伤口划过已经变硬的地方，不让钓线滑入手掌，也不让手指被割伤。

如果男孩在这里，他会把线浸湿的，他想。是的。如果男孩在这里。如果男孩在这里。

钓线不断地拉出去，但现在速度放慢了，他让鱼为每一英寸线都付出劳动。现在他从原木上抬起头来，从他的脸颊上被压扁的鱼肉中抬起头。然后他跪了下来，慢慢站起身来。他正在放线，但放得越来越慢。他移动到能用脚感觉到卷起来的线圈的位置。线还很充足，现在鱼要拉着所有那些新线通过水中的摩擦。

是的，他想。现在他跳了十多次，背部的袋子里装满了空气，他不能深入水底去死，我也无法把他拉上来。他很快会开始盘旋，那时我就必须应对。我想知道是什么突然让它发动了？是饥饿让他绝望了吗，还是夜晚的某些事情吓到了他？也许他突然感到恐惧。但他是那样平静、强壮的鱼，看起来无畏、自信。这很奇怪。

“你最好也要像那条老人一样无畏、自信，”他说。“你又抓住了他，但你没有线了。但很快他就得盘旋。”

老人用左手和肩膀拿住他，弯下身来，用右手舀起水，清洗掉脸上压扁的海豚肉。他害怕这会让他作呕，于是他会吐，失去力量。脸被清洗干净后，他把右手在船边的水中洗干净，然后让手继续浸在盐水中，看着日出之前的第一缕光线。他几乎朝东走，他想。那说明他累了，跟着潮流走。很快他就得盘旋。那么我们真正的工作就开始了。

他估计右手在水中泡了足够长的时间后，就把手拿出来看了看。

“还好，”他说。“男人不该在意疼痛。”

他小心翼翼地抓住钓线，以免划伤任何新的伤口，转移重心，让左手进入船的另一边的海水中。

“对于一个毫无价值的东西来说，你做得还不错，”他对左手说。“但有一个时刻我找不到你。”

我为什么不生来就有两只好手呢？他想。也许是因为我没有好好训练那只手的缘故。但上帝知道他有足够的机会去学习。虽然在夜里他表现还不错，只发生了一次抽筋。如果他再抽筋的话……".

let the line cut him off.
When he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and he thought he
should chew some more of the dolphin. But I can’t, he told himself. It is better to be
light-headed than to lose your strength from nausea. And I know I cannot keep it if I eat
it since my face was in it. I will keep it for an emergency until it goes bad. But it is too late
to try for strength now through nourishment. You’re stupid, he told himself. Eat the other
flying fish.
It was there, cleaned and ready, and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it
chewing the bones carefully and eating all of it down to the tail.
It has more nourishment than almost any fish, he [85] thought. At least the kind of
strength that I need. Now I have done what I can, he thought. Let him begin to circle and
let the fight come.
The sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to
circle.
He could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling. It was too early for
that. He just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull
on it gently with his right hand. It tightened, as always, but just when he reached the
point where it would break, line began to come in. He slipped his shoulders and head
from under the line and began to pull in line steadily and gently. He used both of his
hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as much as he could with his body
and his legs. His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of the pulling.
“It is a very big circle,” he said. “But he is circling.” Then the line would not come in
any more and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun. Then it started
out and the old man knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water.
“He is making the far part of his circle now,” he said. I must hold all I can, he
thought. The strain will [86] shorten his circle each time. Perhaps in an hour I will see
him. Now I must convince him and then I must kill him.
But the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired
deep into his bones two hours later. But the circles were much shorter now and from the
way the line slanted he could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam.
For an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat
salted his eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead. He was not afraid of
the black spots. They were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line. Twice,
though, he had felt faint and dizzy and that had worried him.
“I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this,” he said. “Now that I have him
coming so beautifully, God help me endure. I’ll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred
Hail Marys. But I cannot say them now.
Consider them said, he thought. I’ll say them later. Just then he felt a sudden
banging and jerking on the line he held with his two hands. It was sharp and hard-feeling
and heavy.

让线把他切断。
当他觉得自己没有头脑清醒的时候，他认为自己应该咀嚼更多的海豚。但我不能，他告诉自己。头晕比因恶心而失去力量更好。我知道如果我吃了它，我不能保持清醒，因为我的脸已经贴在上面。我会留着它以备不时之需，直到变质。但现在通过营养获得力量已经太迟了。你真蠢，他告诉自己。吃掉其他的飞鱼。
它已经准备好了，他用左手拿起来，小心地咀嚼骨头，吃完所有直到尾巴。
他想，几乎比任何鱼都有更多的营养。至少是我需要的那种力量。现在我已经尽力了，他想。让他开始盘旋，让战斗开始。
太阳升起来了，这是他出海来第三次看到太阳升起的时候，鱼开始盘旋。
他无法通过线的斜度看到鱼在盘旋。现在还太早。他只是感觉到线的压力略微减轻，然后开始用右手轻拉。它像往常一样变紧，但就在他达到可能断掉的点时，线开始收缩。他从线的压力下挪开肩膀和头，然后开始稳定和轻轻地拉线。他用双手摆动并尽可能用身体和腿来拉。他老旧的腿和肩膀随着摆动而旋转。
“这是一个很大的圈，”他说。“但是他在盘旋。”然后线就不再收缩了，他抓住它直到看到阳光中的水滴跳出。然后它出去了，老人跪下，不情愿地让它回到黑暗的水中。
“他现在在做他圈的远处，”他说。我必须尽力抓住一切，他想。压力会逐渐缩小他的圈。也许一个小时后我会看到他。现在我必须说服他，然后我必须杀死他。
但鱼继续缓慢盘旋，两个小时后，老人浑身大汗，疲惫到骨髓。但现在圈子变得短得多，从线的倾斜方式可以看出，鱼一直在不断上升。
一个小时前，老人的眼前一直见黑点，汗水盐在他的眼睛上，也在他的眼睛上和前额上的伤口上。他不害怕黑点。在他在线上施加的张力下，这是正常的。然而，他两次感到头晕和眩晕，这让他担心。
“我不能让自己在这样的鱼上失败而死去，”他说。“现在我让他这么漂亮地来，上帝帮助我忍耐。我会说一百遍，我们的父亲，和一百遍圣母玛利亚。但我现在不能说。
认为他们已经被说出来了，他想。我以后再说。就在那时，他感到线在他双手中突然猛烈而牵扯。感觉尖锐，沉重。

He is hitting the wire leader with his spear, he [87] thought. That was bound to come.
He had to do that. It may make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling
now. The jumps were necessary for him to take air. But after that each one can widen the
opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook.
“Don’t jump, fish,” he said. “Don’t jump.”
The fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the old
man gave up a little line.
I must hold his pain where it is, he thought. Mine does not matter. I can control
mine. But his pain could drive him mad.
After a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again.
The old man was gaining line steadily now. But he felt faint again. He lifted some sea
water with his left hand and put it on his head. Then he put more on and rubbed the back
of his neck.
“I have no cramps,” he said. “He’ll be up soon and I can last. You have to last. Don’t
even speak of it.”
He kneeled against the bow and, for a moment, slipped the line over his back again.
I’ll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he
comes in, he decided.
[88] It was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by
himself without recovering any line. But when the strain showed the fish had turned to
come toward the boat, the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the
weaving pulling that brought in all the line he gained.
I’m tireder than I have ever been, he thought, and now the trade wind is rising. But
that will be good to take him in with. I need that badly.
“I’ll rest on the next turn as he goes out,” he said. “I feel much better. Then in two or
three turns more I will have him.”
His straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the bow with the
pull of the line as he felt the fish turn.
You work now, fish, he thought. I’ll take you at the turn.
The sea had risen considerably. But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it
to get home.
“I’ll just steer south and west,” he said. “A man is never lost at sea and it is a long
island.”
It was on the third turn that he saw the fish first.
He saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long [89] to pass under the boat that
he could not believe its length.

他用长矛击打铁丝钩，他想。这是注定会发生的。
他必须这样做。这可能会让他跳动，但我宁愿他继续盘旋。
跳动对他来说是必要的，让他能够呼吸空气。但在那之后，每一次跳动都会扩大鱼钩伤口的口子，让他能把鱼钩甩掉。
“别跳，鱼儿，”他说。“别跳。”
鱼儿又撞击了几次铁丝钩，每次摇头的时候，老人就会放出一些线。
我必须让他的疼痛保持在原地，他想。我的不重要。我可以控制我的。但他的疼痛可能会让他发狂。
过了一会儿，鱼停止了在铁丝钩上的拍打，又开始慢慢盘旋。老人现在稳步拉动着线。但他又感到虚弱。他用左手捧起一些海水，倒在头上。然后再倒一些，并摩擦着脖颈。
“我没有抽筋，”他说。“他马上就会上浮，而我会坚持下去。你必须坚持。甚至别提它。”
他跪在船头，瞬间又将钓线拉过背后。
我现在会休息，等他绕出一圈后再起来对付他，他决定说。
眼看鱼自己绕出一个圈子而不用回收任何线，这是一个极大的诱惑。但当拉力显示鱼已转向船时，老人站起身，开始扭转和织动，将他获得的所有线收回来。
我比以往任何时候都更疲惫，他想，现在贸易风正在升起。但这对我好，能把他拉回来。我非常需要这个。
“下一个转弯时我会休息，当他离开时，”他说。“我感觉好多了。再过两三个转弯，我就能制服他。”
他的草帽被推到了后面，他感觉到鱼转身时，被拉的线让他陷入船头。
你现在要工作了，鱼，他想。我会在转弯时抓住你。
海浪已经大起。但那是适合航行的和风，他需要它回家。
“我只会向南和西舵，”他说。“人在海上不会迷失，这是一个很大的岛屿。”
在第三个转弯的时候，他第一次看到了鱼。
他一开始将鱼看作一个黑暗的影子，花了很长时间才从船底下穿过，让他无法相信鱼有这么长。

“No,” he said. “He can’t be that big.”
But he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty
yards away and the man saw his tail out of water. It was higher than a big scythe blade
and a very pale lavender above the dark blue water. It raked back and as the fish swam
just below the surface the old man could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that
banded him. His dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals were spread wide.
On this circle the old man could see the fish’s eye and the two gray sucking fish that
swain around him. Sometimes they attached themselves to him. Sometimes they darted
off. Sometimes they would swim easily in his shadow. They were each over three feet long
and when they swam fast they lashed their whole bodies like eels.
The old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun. On each
calm placid turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in two turns
more he would have a chance to get the harpoon in.
[90] But I must get him close, close, close, he thought. I mustn’t try for the head. I
must get the heart.
“Be calm and strong, old man,” he said.
On the next circle the fish’s beck was out but he was a little too far from the boat. On
the next circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the old man
was sure that by gaining some more line he could have him alongside.
He had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in a round basket
and the end was made fast to the bitt in the bow.
The fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his
great tail moving. The old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer. For
just a moment the fish turned a little on his side. Then he straightened himself and began
another circle.
“I moved him,” the old man said. “I moved him then.”
He felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could. I
moved him, he thought. Maybe this time I can get him over. Pull, hands, he thought.
Hold up, legs. Last for me, head. Last for me. You never went. This time I’ll pull him over.
[91] But when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the fish came
alongside and pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled part way over and then righted
himself and swam away.
“Fish,” the old man said. “Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to
kill me too?”
That way nothing is accomplished, he thought. His mouth was too dry to speak but
he could not reach for the water now. I must get him alongside this time, he thought. I
am not good for many more turns. Yes you are, he told himself. You’re good for ever.

但是它确实很大，当它绕完圈子的尽头时，它只离老人三十码远出浮水面，老人看到了它的尾巴。它比大镰刀还要高，深蓝色的水面上方是非常苍白的淡紫色。它向后薅动着，鱼在水面下游动时，老人能看到它庞大的身躯和条纹。它的背鳍下垂，巨大的胸鳍展开。
在这个圈子里，老人可以看到鱼的眼睛和周围游动的两只灰色吸附鱼。有时它们附着在它身上，有时它们突然游开。有时它们会在它的阴影下轻松游动。它们每只都超过三英尺长，当它们快速游动时，会像鳗鱼一样摆动整个身体。
老人现在开始出汗，但不是因为太阳。在每一次平静的转弯中，鱼都在获得线条，老人确信再过两个转弯他就有机会刺中鱼。
但我必须让它靠近，靠近，靠近，他想。我不该去尝试射中头部，我必须射中心脏。
“保持冷静和坚强，老人。”他说。
在下一个圈子里，鱼的背鳍露出，但离船还有点远。在下一个圈子里，它仍然离船太远，但它的身体露出水面更高了，老人确信再多拉些线，他就能让它靠近。
他很早就已经准备好了鱼叉，并把一捆轻绳放在一个圆形篮子里，末端系在船头的钉子上。
鱼现在正在悠闲而美丽地绕着圈子游动，只有它巨大的尾巴在摆动。老人尽其所能地拉扯它，让它靠近。鱼稍稍侧身了一下，然后直立起来，开始另一个圈子。
“我让它动了，”老人说。“我让它动了。”他现在感到有些虚弱，但他尽其所能地捉住这条巨大的鱼。我让它动了，他想。也许这一次我能把它拉上来。拉紧，手，他想。坚持住，腿。最后，头。为我最后一把。你从来没有失败过。这一次我要把它拉上来。
但是当他竭尽全力，鱼擦肩而过时开始用力，他拉得全心全意，鱼被拉了部分过来，然后重新竖立身躯，游走。

“鱼，”老人说。“鱼，你终究会死。你难道还要连累我吗？”
他想这样做没有任何意义。他的嘴太干了，无法说话，但他现在无法够到水。他得让它这次靠近，他想。我已经不能再继续太多圈了。是的，你可以，他告诉自己。你永远都可以。

On the next turn, he nearly had him. But again the fish righted himself and swam
slowly away.
You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I
seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother.
Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who.
Now you are getting confused in the head, he thought. You must keep your head
clear. Keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man. Or a fish, he thought.
“Clear up, head,” he said in a voice he could hardly hear. “Clear up.”
[92] Twice more it was the same on the turns. I do not know, the old man thought.
He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time. I do not know. But I will try it
once more. He tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish. The
fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air. I’ll
try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could
only see well in flashes. He tried it again and it was the same. So he thought, and he felt
himself going before he started; I will try it once again.
He took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he
put it against the fish’s agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his
side, his bill almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat, long,
deep, wide, silver and barred with purple and interminable in the water.
The old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as
he could and drove it down with all his strength, and more strength he had [93] just
summoned, into the fish’s side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to
the altitude of the man’s chest. He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it
further and then pushed all his weight after it.
Then the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water
showing all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty. He seemed to
hang in the air above the old man in the skiff. Then he fell into the water with a crash that
sent spray over the old man and over all of the skiff.
The old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well. But he cleared the harpoon
line and let it run slowly through his raw hands and, when he could see, he saw the fish
was on his back with his silver belly up. The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an
angle from the fish’s shoulder and the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from
his heart. First it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that was more than a mile deep.
Then it spread like a cloud. The fish was silvery and still and floated with the waves.
The old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had. Then he took two
turns of the harpoon [94] line around the bitt in the bow and hid his head on his hands.
“Keep my head dear,” he said against the wood of the bow. “I am a tired old man. But
I have killed this fish which is my brother and now I must do the slave work.”
Now I must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside, he thought. Even
if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out, this skiff would never

在下一个转弯时，他几乎把鱼给搞定了。但是鱼再次恢复平衡，缓缓游开。
你在逼死我，鱼，老人心想。但你有权利这样做。我从未见过比你更伟大、更美丽、更平静、更高贵的东西，兄弟。
来吧，杀了我吧。谁杀谁我都不在乎。
现在你开始头脑混乱了，他想。你必须保持头脑清醒。保持头脑清醒，像个男人一样学会承受。或者像一条鱼一样，他想。
“清醒一点，头！”他的声音几乎听不到。“清醒一点。”
接下来的两次转弯情况与之前一样。我不知道，老人想。他每次都觉得自己快不行了。我不知道。但我会再试一次。他再次尝试，当他转动鱼时，感觉自己要倒下了。鱼恢复平衡后，又慢慢游开，伟大的尾巴在空中摇摆。我会再试一次，老人承诺，尽管他的手现在已经软绵绵的，只能时不时看见。他再试了一次，结果却一样。所以他想，他还没开始，就感觉自己快不行了；我要再试一次。
他承受了自己的所有痛苦和剩余的力量，以及早已消失的骄傲，全都对准了鱼的痛苦，鱼转到了他的身边，温和地游到他的身边，嘴巴几乎碰到了木船的船板，开始从船边慢慢经过，长长的、深深的、宽阔的、银色的、紫色相间的，在水中无边无际。
老人放下了绳子，踩在上面，尽可能把鱼叉举得高高的，竭尽全力往下刺，而且动用了他刚刚召唤出的更多力量，刺中了鱼的身体，正好在那巨大的胸鳍后面，胸鳍高高地矗立在空中，与老人的胸部齐平。他感觉到铁叉刺入鱼的身体，他用力靠着铁叉，继续往下刺，然后全身重量顶在上面。
然后，鱼在死中挣扎，从水中飞跃起来，展现出他所有的长度、宽度、力量和美丽。他似乎悬浮在空中，高高在老人的木船上方。然后他坠入水中，发出巨响，溅起浪花，洒过老人和整个木船。
老人感到头晕目眩，他视力模糊。但他拿起鱼叉绳，让它在生疼的手掌间缓慢滑动，当他看清楚时，他看到鱼仰面朝上，沿着他的银色肚子。鱼叉的杆正斜斜地从鱼的肩膀上射出，海水因心脏的血液变红。起初它在超过一英里深的蓝水中像一个暗深的暗礁。然后扩散开来，像一团云。鱼含糊而静止，随波漂浮。
老人仔细观察他所看到的片段。然后，他在船头的吊铁上绕了两个圈，把头埋在双手之间。
他对着船头木材说：“保持我头脑清醒。我是一个疲惫的老人。但我杀了这条鱼，他是我兄弟，现在我必须做苦力活。”
现在我必须准备好绳环和绳索，把他捆在船旁，他想。即使我们两个人把她打翻了把他放上去，船也永远无法...

hold him. I must prepare everything, then bring him in and lash him well and step the
mast and set sail for home.
He started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line
through his gills and out his mouth and make his head fast alongside the bow. I want to
see him, he thought, and to touch and to feel him. He is my fortune, he thought. But that
is not why I wish to feel him. I think I felt his heart, he thought. When I pushed on the
harpoon shaft the second time. Bring him in now and make him fast and get the noose
around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to the skiff.
“Get to work, old man,” he said. He took a very [95] small drink of the water. “There
is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is over.”
He looked up at the sky and then out to his fish. He looked at the sun carefully. It is
not much more than noon, he thought. And the trade wind is rising. The lines all mean
nothing now. The boy and I will splice them when we are home.
“Come on, fish,” he said. But the fish did not come.
Instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff upon
to him.
When he was even with him and had the fish’s head against the bow he could not
believe his size. But he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt, passed it through the fish’s
gills and out his jaws, made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the
other gill, made another turn around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it
fast to the bitt in the bow. He cut the rope then and went astern to noose the tail. The fish
had turned silver from his original purple and silver, and the stripes showed the same
pale violet colour as his tail. They were wider than a man’s hand with his fingers spread
and the fish’s eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a saint in a
procession.
[96] “It was the only way to kill him,” the old man said. He was feeling better since
the water and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear. He’s over fifteen
hundred pounds the way he is, he thought. Maybe much more. If he dresses out
two-thirds of that at thirty cents a pound?
“I need a pencil for that,” he said. “My head is not that clear. But I think the great
DiMaggio would be proud of me today. I had no bone spurs. But the hands and the back
hurt truly.” I wonder what a bone spur is, he thought. Maybe we have them without
knowing of it.
He made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart. He was so big it
was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside. He cut a piece of line and tied the fish’s
lower jaw against his bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as
possible. Then he stepped the mast and, with the stick that was his gaff and with his
boom rigged, the patched sail drew, the boat began to move, and half lying in the stern he
sailed south-west.
He did not need a compass to tell him where southwest was. He only needed the feel

抓住他。我必须准备好一切，然后把他带进来，好好地拴住他，升起桅杆，然后扬帆回家。
他开始把鱼拉到身边，让他靠近，这样他就可以通过鱼的腮部穿过一根绳子，并从嘴巴里拉出来，把他的头栓在船头旁边。我想看看他，他想着，想触摸他，感受他。他是我的幸运，他想。但这不是我想要感受他的原因。我想我感受到了他的心跳，他想。当我第二次用鱼叉杆推进时。现在把他拉进来，把他固定好，把一个环套住他的尾巴，另一个环套住他的身体，把他绑在小船上。
“老人，干活吧，”他说。他小小地喝了一口水。“现在战斗已经结束，有很多苦力活要做。”
他抬头望着天空，然后看向他的鱼。他仔细看着太阳。他想，现在差不多是中午，贸易风正在起。现在所有的绳子都毫无意义了。回家后，男孩和我会把它们拼接起来。
“来吧，鱼，”他说。但是鱼没有过来。
相反，他躺在海里翻滚，老人把小船拉到他面前。
当他和他齐平，并把鱼的头靠在船头时，他不敢相信他的大小。但他解开鱼叉绳子，穿过鱼的腮部和嘴巴，绕过他的喉咙，然后穿过另一侧的腮部，绕过嘴巴再打结，把双重绳子固定在船头的绞钩上。然后他剪掉了绳子，走到船尾去套住鱼尾。鱼已经从原来的紫色和银色变成了银色，斑纹显示出与他的尾巴一样的淡紫色。它们比一个人伸开手指后的手掌还要宽，鱼的眼睛看起来像潜望镜中的镜子一样无表情，或者像一个圣人在游行中那样。
“这是唯一的杀死他的方法，”老人说。自从喝了水后，他感觉好多了，他知道自己不会离开，头脑也清晰了。他现在至少超过了1500磅，他想。也许还要多。如果以每磅三十分钱的价格卖掉他的两三分之一？
“我需要一支铅笔，”他说。“我的头脑没有那么清晰。但我想迪马吉奥会为我感到骄傲的。我没有骨刺。但手和背真的很疼。”我在想什么是骨刺，他想。也许我们有却不自知。
他把鱼分别捆在船头、船尾和中间的横杆上。他太大了，就像系着一条更大船只一样。他剪了一截绳子，把鱼的下颚系在虹吸管的嘴上，这样他的嘴不会张开，他们可以航行得尽可能干净。然后他升起桅杆，用那根当作鱼叉的木杆，带着装甲的帆开始拉动，小船开始移动，他半躺在船尾，向西南方向航行。
他并不需要罗盘告诉他西南方向在哪里。他只需要感觉。

of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail. I better put a small line [97] out with a
spoon on it and try and get something to eat and drink for the moisture. But he could not
find a spoon and his sardines were rotten. So he hooked a patch of yellow Gulf weed with
the gaff as they passed and shook it so that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the
planking of the skiff. There were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked
like sand fleas. The old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and forefinger and
ate them chewing up the shells and the tails. They were very tiny but he knew they were
nourishing and they tasted good.
The old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after
he had eaten the shrimps. The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he
steered with the tiller under his arm. He could see the fish and he had only to look at his
hands and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was
not a dream. At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, he had thought
perhaps it was a dream. Then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and hang
motionless in the sky before he fell, he was sure there was some great strangeness and he
could not believe it.
[98] Then he could not see well, although now he saw as well as ever. Now he knew
there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream. The hands cure quickly, he
thought. I bled them clean and the salt water will heal them. The dark water of the true
gulf is the greatest healer that there is. All I must do is keep the head clear. The hands
have done their work and we sail well. With his mouth shut and his tail straight up and
down we sail like brothers. Then his head started to become a little unclear and he
thought, is he bringing me in or am I bringing him in? If I were towing him behind there
would be no question. Nor if the fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone, there would
be no question either. But they were sailing together lashed side by side and the old man
thought, let him bring me in if it pleases him. I am only better than him through trickery
and he meant me no harm.
They sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep
his head clear. There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the
old man knew the breeze would last all night. The old man looked at the fish constantly
[99] to make sure it was true. It was an hour before the first shark hit him.
The shark was not an accident. He had come up from deep down in the water as the
dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea. He had come up so
fast and absolutely without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in
the sun. Then he fell back into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on
the course the skiff and the fish had taken.
Sometimes he lost the scent. But he would pick it up again, or have just a trace of it,
and he swam fast and hard on the course. He was a very big Make shark built to swim as
fast as the fastest fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws.
His back was as blue as a sword fish’s and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth
and handsome. He was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight
shut now as he swam fast, just under the surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through
the water without wavering. Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of
teeth were slanted inwards. They were not the ordinary pyramid-shaped teeth of most

老人的瓶子里还剩下两口水，吃完小虾后他用了其中一半。考虑到劣势，小船航行得不错，他用舵托在胳膊下操舵。他可以看到鱼，他只需要看看自己的手，感受背靠在舵船的船尾上，就知道这确实发生了，不是梦。有一次，在末尾感觉很糟糕时，他曾以为这也许是个梦。然后，当他看到鱼从水中跳出，在空中静止悬挂之前，他确信这里有一些伟大的奇异，他很难相信。
然后他的视力不好，尽管现在能看见得很清楚。现在他知道那是真的有鱼，他的手和背也不是梦。手很快就会痊愈，他想。我把它们流血洗净，盐水会治愈它们。真正的海湾的黑暗水域是最好的疗愈者。我要做的就是保持头脑清醒。手已经做好了他们的工作，我们航行得不错。这只鱼口闭着，尾巴直竖着，我们像兄弟一样航行。然后他开始感到有点头脑不清晰，他想，是他将我带进来，还是我将他带进来？如果我把他拖在后面，就不会有问题。或者如果鱼在船上，所有尊严都丧失了，也不会有问题。但它们被捆在一起并排航行，老人想，如果他想带我进来，那就让他带我进来吧。我只是比他更聪明一些，他并没有伤害我。
他们航行得不错，老人用盐水浸泡他的手，试图保持头脑清醒。有高积云和足够多的卷云在上面，老人知道微风会持续整夜。老人不断地看着鱼，确保它是真的。一个小时后，第一只鲨鱼袭击了他。
鲨鱼并不是偶然。当深处的水中血色的黑云沉淀并在深海的一英里中散开时，它从水深处升起。它上升得如此迅速且绝对没有谨慎，以至于破开蓝色水面，沐浴在阳光之中。然后它又掉回海中，嗅到气味，开始朝着船和鱼的航线游动。
有时它会丢失气味，但它会再次捡起它，或者仅留下一点，然后在航线上快速游动。它是一只非常大的鲨鱼，它身形修长，可以像海洋中最快的鱼一样快速游动，他的一切都很美丽，除了它的大嘴。它的背蓝得像一只剑鱼，肚子是银白色的，皮肤光滑而英俊。它的身材像一只剑鱼一样修长，只是它巨大的嘴现在紧闭着，随着高高的背鳍在水中划过，毫不动摇。在它紧闭的双唇内部，所有八排牙齿都向内倾斜。它们不是普通的金字塔形牙齿，大多数鲨鱼都有的样子。

sharks. They were shaped like a man’s [100] fingers when they are crisped like claws.
They were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man and they had razor-sharp cutting
edges on both sides. This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea, that were so
fast and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy. Now he speeded up as he
smelled the fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water.
When the old man saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had no fear at
all and would do exactly what he wished. He prepared the harpoon and made the rope
fast while he watched the shark come on. The rope was short as it lacked what he had cut
away to lash the fish.
The old man’s head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had
little hope. It was too good to last, he thought. He took one look at the great fish as he
watched the shark close in. It might as well have been a dream, he thought. I cannot keep
him from hitting me but maybe I can get him. Dentuso, he thought. Bad luck to your
mother.
The shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth
open and his strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the
meat just above the tail. The shark’s head [101] was out of water and his back was coming
out and the old man could hear the noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he
rammed the harpoon down onto the shark’s head at a spot where the line between his
eyes intersected with the line that ran straight back from his nose. There were no such
lines. There was only the heavy sharp blue head and the big eyes and the clicking,
thrusting all-swallowing jaws. But that was the location of the brain and the old man hit
it. He hit it with his blood mushed hands driving a good harpoon with all his strength. He
hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy.
The shark swung over and the old man saw his eye was not alive and then he swung
over once again, wrapping himself in two loops of the rope. The old man knew that he
was dead but the shark would not accept it. Then, on his back, with his tail lashing and
his jaws clicking, the shark plowed over the water as a speedboat does. The water was
white where his tail beat it and three-quarters of his body was clear above the water when
the rope came taut, shivered, and then snapped. The shark lay quietly for a little while on
the surface and the old man watched him. Then he went down very slowly.
[102] “He took about forty pounds,” the old man said aloud. He took my harpoon too
and all the rope, he thought, and now my fish bleeds again and there will be others. He
did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been mutilated. When the fish had
been hit it was as though he himself were hit. But I killed the shark that hit my fish, he
thought. And he was the biggest dentuso that I have ever seen. And God knows that I
have seen big ones. It was too good to last, he thought. I wish it had been a dream now
and that I had never hooked the fish and was alone in bed on the newspapers.
“But man is not made for defeat,” he said. “A man can be destroyed but not
defeated.” I am sorry that I killed the fish though, he thought. Now the bad time is
coming and I do not even have the harpoon. The dentuso is cruel and able and strong and
intelligent. But I was more intelligent than he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I
was only better armed.

鲨鱼。它们形状像一个人的手指，当它们像爪子一样炸脆时。
它们几乎和老人的手指一样长，两边都有锋利的切割
边缘。这是一种建造来吃海中所有的鱼的鱼，它们是如此
快速、强壮和武装齐全，以至于它们没有其他敌人。现在他闻到了更清新的气味，他加速了，他的蓝色背鳍切过水面。
当老人看到它靠近时，他知道这是一条毫无恐惧的鲨鱼，会按照他的意愿去做。他准备好了鱼叉，把绳子拴牢，同时注视着鲨鱼的靠近。由于缺少割掉的那部分用来捆绑鱼的鱼线，绳子很短。
老人头脑清晰，意志坚定，但希望渺茫。他想，这太美好了，终究会结束的。当他看着鲨鱼靠近时，他再次瞥了一眼大鱼。他想这就好像是一个梦，他想。我无法阻止它击中我，但也许我能击中它。丹图索，他想。祝你妈妈倒霉。
鲨鱼快速靠近尾部，当它击中鱼时，老人看到它的嘴张开，奇怪的眼睛和牙齿密集的啮合声在鱼的尾部上方切进肉里。鲨鱼的头部露出了水面，它的背部浮出水面，当老人将鱼叉刺向鲨鱼头部，刺入鲨鱼的头部时，老人能听到大鱼的皮肤和肉撕裂的声音。刺下去的位置正好在它眼睛之间的直线和从鼻子向后的直线交叉的点。没有这样的线条。只有沉重的蓝色大头和大眼睛以及咔哒咔哒、推进、吞没的大嘴。但那里是大脑的位置，老人命中了。他用血泥的手用全力驱动鱼叉刺中它。他毫无希望地击中了它，但充满了决心和完全的恶意。
鲨鱼翻过身，老人看到它的眼睛已经不活了，然后它再次翻身，用绳子缠绕在两圈。老人知道它已经死了，但鲨鱼不接受这个事实。然后，趴在背上，尾巴拍打着，嘴巴不断地咔哒咔哒作响，鲨鱼就像一艘快艇一样在水上疾驶。在它的尾巴拍打时，水面变白了，它的身体三分之四以上清晰地浮在水面上，绳子变得紧绷、颤动，然后断裂。鲨鱼在水面上安静地停了一会儿，老人看着它。然后它缓慢地下沉。
“它吃掉了大概四十磅，”老人大声说道。它也把我的鱼叉和所有的绳子都带走了，他想，现在我的鱼又在流血了，还会有其他鲨鱼过来。自从被毁坏以后，他就不想再看这条鱼了。当这条鱼被击中时，就好像是他自己被击中了。不过我杀了击中鱼的那条鲨鱼，他想。那是我见过的最大的丹图索。上帝知道我见过多大的。他想，这太美好了，我希望这只是一个梦，我从来没有钓到这条鱼，在报纸上独自躺在床上。
“但人类不是为失败而生的，”他说。一个人可以被摧毁，但不能被打倒。虽然我很遗憾杀死了鱼，他想。现在糟糕的时刻即将到来，而我甚至没有鱼叉了。丹图索残酷、善于、强壮和聪明。但我比它更聪明。也许不是，他想。也许我只是装备更好。

except the time the sting ray stung it when I stepped on him when swimming and
paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain.
“Think about something cheerful, old man,” he said. “Every minute now you are
closer to home. You sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds.”
He knew quite well the pattern of what could happen when he reached the inner part
of the current. But there was nothing to be done now.
“Yes there is,” he said aloud. “I can lash my knife to the butt of one of the oars.”
So he did that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the sail under his foot.
“Now,” he said. “I am still an old man. But I am not unarmed.”
The breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well. He watched only the forward part of
the fish and some of his hope returned.
It is silly not to hope, he thought. Besides I believe [104] it is a sin. Do not think
about sin, he thought. There are enough problems now without sin. Also I have no
understanding of it.
I have no understanding of it and I am not sure that I believe in it. Perhaps it was a
sin to kill the fish. I suppose it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many
people. But then everything is a sin. Do not think about sin. It is much too late for that
and there are people who are paid to do it. Let them think about it. You were born to be a
fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish. San Pedro was a fisherman as was the father
of the great DiMaggio.
But he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and since there was
nothing to read and he did not have a radio, he thought much and he kept on thinking
about sin. You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he thought. You
killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive
and you loved him after. If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?
“You think too much, old man,” he said aloud.
But you enjoyed killing the dentuso, he thought. He lives on the live fish as you do.
He is not a scavenger [105] nor just a moving appetite as some sharks are. He is beautiful
and noble and knows no fear of anything.
“I killed him in self-defense,” the old man said aloud. “And I killed him well.”
Besides, he thought, everything kills everything else in some way. Fishing kills me
exactly as it keeps me alive. The boy keeps me alive, he thought. I must not deceive

但我必须要想，他心想。因为这是我剩下的一切。还有棒球。我想知道伟大的迪玛吉奥会不会喜欢我击中他的脑袋的方式？他心想，这没什么了不起。任何人都能做到。但你认为我的手像骨刺一样是一个很大的障碍吗？我无法知道。除了有一次游泳时踩到黄貂鱼刺刺伤脚跟，导致下肢麻痹和难忍的疼痛，我的脚跟从来没有出过问题。

“想点开心的事，老人”，他说，“现在每一分钟你离家又近了一步。你因为失去四十磅而航行得更轻。”

他很清楚到了内流部分会发生什么。但现在已经无计可施。

“是有的，”他大声说道，“我可以把刀绑在桨的底部。”于是他把刀绑在了舵杆下面，风帆的绳子夹在脚底下。

“现在，”他说，“我依然是个老人。但我不是手无寸铁。”

微风现在变得清凉，他航行得很顺利。他只盯着鱼的前半身，希望回来了一些。

不希望是愚蠢的，他心想。而且我认为这是一种罪过。不要去想罪过，他心想。现在已经够多问题了，没有必要再罪过。此外我也不太了解。

我不太明白，也不确定我是否相信罪过。或许杀死那条鱼是一种罪。我想应该是，尽管我是为了维持生命，为了喂养许多人才做的。但是万物都是罪。不要去想罪过。现在为时已晚，而且有人是为了去想这个而被付费。让他们去想。你生来是渔夫，鱼生来是鱼。圣佩德罗是个渔夫，就像伟大的迪玛吉奥的父亲一样。

但他喜欢思考自己参与的一切事情，由于没有东西可读也没有收音机，他想了很多，并且继续想着罪过。你杀鱼不只是为了活下去和卖给别人当食物，他心想。你杀鱼是出于自豪和作为一名渔夫。当它还活着时你爱它，它死后你也爱它。如果你爱它，杀它不算是罪。还是说它有更多？

“你想得太多了，老人，”他大声说。

但你享受杀死那条锯齿鲨的过程，他心想。它吃活鱼，就像你一样。它不是清道夫，也不只是某些鲨鱼一样的移动食欲。它是美丽而高贵的，不畏惧一切。

“我是为了自卫而杀它的，”老人大声说。“而且我杀得很好。”

此外，他心想，每样东西都以某种方式互相消灭。捕鱼既让我死亡又让我活着。男孩让我活着，他心想。我不能欺骗-39-

myself too much.
He leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the
shark had cut him. He chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste. It was firm and
juicy, like meat, but it was not red. There was no stringiness in it and he knew that it
would bring the highest price In the market. But there was no way to keep its scent out of
the water and the old man knew that a very had time was coming.
The breeze was steady. It had backed a little further into the north-east and he knew
that meant that it would not fall off. The old man looked ahead of him but he could see no
sails nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of any ship. There were only the flying fish
that went up from his bow sailing away to either side and the yellow patches of Gulf weed.
He could not even see a bird.
[106] He had sailed for two hours, resting in the stern and sometimes chewing a bit
of the meat from the marlin, trying to rest and to be strong, when he saw the first of the
two sharks. “Ay,” he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is
just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his
hands and into the wood.
“Galanos,” he said aloud. He had seen the second fin now coming up behind the first
and had identified them as shovel-nosed sharks by the brown, triangular fin and the
sweeping movements of the tail. They had the scent and were excited and in the stupidity
of their great hunger they were losing and finding the scent in their excitement. But they
were closing all the time.
The old man made the sheet fast and jammed the tiller. Then he took up the oar with
the knife lashed to it. He lifted it as lightly as he could because his hands rebelled at the
pain. Then he opened and closed them on it lightly to loosen them. He closed them firmly
so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watched the sharks come. He
could see their wide, flattened, shovel-pointed heads now and their white tipped wide
pectoral fins. They were hateful sharks, [107] bad smelling, scavengers as well as killers,
and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat. It was these
sharks that would cut the turtles’ legs and flippers off when the turtles were asleep on the
surface, and they would hit a man in the water, if they were hungry, even if the man had
no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him.
“Ay,” the old man said. “Galanos. Come on galanos.”
They came. But they did not come as the Mako had come. One turned and went out
of sight under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff shake as he jerked and pulled
on the fish. The other watched the old man with his slitted yellow eyes and then came in
fast with his half circle of jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten. The
line showed clearly on the top of his brown head and back where the brain joined the
spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the oar into the juncture, withdrew it, and
drove it in again into the shark’s yellow cat-like eyes. The shark let go of the fish and slid
down, swallowing what he had taken as he died.
The skiff was still shaking with the destruction the other shark was doing to the fish
and the old man let [108] go the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadside and bring

我太自我了。
他俯身到船边，拽下鲨鱼被咬过的肉块。他咀嚼着，品尝着它的质地和美味。它坚实多汁，像肉，但不是红色的。没有丝状物质，他知道这将会在市场上卖个好价钱。但是无法避免它在水中散发的气味，老人知道困难将会来临。
微风吹拂着。它稍微向东北方向偏转，他知道意味着不会消失。老人向前望去，但看不见帆也看不见船体，也没有看见任何船只的烟。只有在他的船头躲闪的飞鱼和墨西哥湾的黄色海草。他甚至看不到一只鸟。
他已经航行了两个小时，在船尾休息时有时咀嚼一些旗鱼肉，试图休息并保持强壮，这时他看到了两只鲨鱼中的第一只。“哎呀，”他大声说。这个词没有翻译，也许只是一个像男人在木头上钉钉子时不经意发出的声音。
“加拉诺斯，”他大声说。他现在看到了第二只鳍鲨从第一只身后追了上来，并通过它们棕色的三角鳍和尾部的摆动动作将它们确定为铲鼻鲨。它们嗅到了气味，兴奋起来，在他们饥饿的愚蠢中不断失去和找到气味。但它们一直在靠近。
老人拉紧了绳子，将舵杆卡住。然后他拿起用刀绑紧的桨。他尽量轻轻地举起它，因为他的手因疼痛而不听使唤。然后他轻轻打开并闭上手，松弛它们。他牢牢闭紧它们，以便现在就承受疼痛，不会畏缩，盯着鲨鱼们靠近。他现在可以看到它们宽阔、扁平、铲状的头和白色尖头的胸鳍。它们是可恶的鲨鱼，气味难闻，不仅是食腐者，也是杀手，当它们饥饿时，它们会咬船桨或船舵。就是这些鲨鱼会在海龟在水面睡觉时切掉它们的腿和鳍，并且如果它们饥饿时，即使那人身上没有鱼血或鱼黏液的气味，也会袭击在水中的人。
“哎呀，”老人说。“加拉诺斯，加油加拉诺斯。”
它们来了。但它们不像鲭鲨那样来。一条鲨鱼转身消失在小艇下面，老人能感觉到小艇在他拉扯着鱼时摇晃。另一只鲨鱼用它那半圆形的大嘴快速向前，要击中已经被咬过的鱼。系绳清晰地显示在它棕色头部和背部上，大脑与脊髓连接处，老人把刀插入桨上，刺进去，然后又刺进鲨鱼黄色像猫的眼睛。鲨鱼放开了鱼，滑落下去，当它死去时吞下了它所吃的。
小船仍在因另一只鲨鱼对鱼的摧毁而摇晃，老人放开了绳索，让小船摆到侧面，将…

the shark out from under. When he saw the shark he leaned over the side and punched at
him. He hit only meat and the hide was set hard and he barely got the knife in. The blow
hurt not only his hands but his shoulder too. But the shark came up fast with his head out
and the old man hit him squarely in the center of his flat-topped head as his nose came
out of water and lay against the fish. The old man withdrew the blade and punched the
shark exactly in the same spot again. He still hung to the fish with his jaws hooked and
the old man stabbed him in his left eye. The shark still hung there.
“No?” the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and the brain.
It was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever. The old man reversed the oar and
put the blade between the shark’s jaws to open them. He twisted the blade and as the
shark slid loose he said, “Go on, galano. Slide down a mile deep. Go see your friend, or
maybe it’s your mother.”
The old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar. Then he found the
sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course.
[109] “They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat,” he said aloud. “I
wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I’m sorry about it, fish. It makes
everything wrong.” He stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now. Drained of
blood and awash he looked the colour of the silver backing of a minor and his stripes still
showed.
“I shouldn’t have gone out so far, fish,” he said. “Neither for you nor for me. I’m
sorry, fish.”
Now, he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut.
Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.
“I wish I had a stone for the knife,” the old man said after he had checked the lashing
on the oar butt. “I should have brought a stone.” You should have brought many things,
he thought. But you did not bring them, old man. Now is no time to think of what you do
not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.
“You give me much good counsel,” he said aloud. “I’m tired of it.” He held the tiller
under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove forward. “God
knows how much that last one took,” he said.
[110] “But she’s much lighter now.” He did not want to think of the mutilated
under-side of the fish. He knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been
meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway
through the sea.
He was a fish to keep a man all winter, he thought Don’t think of that. Just rest and
try to get your hands in shape to defend what is left of him. The blood smell from my
hands means nothing now with all that scent in the water. Besides they do not bleed
much. There is nothing cut that means anything. The bleeding may keep the left from
cramping.
What can I think of now? he thought. Nothing. I must think of nothing and wait for

他看见鲨鱼正从下面游过来。他看到鲨鱼后，俯身在船边用拳头猛击。他只打到了肉，鲨鱼的皮厚而硬，他勉强将刀插入。这一击不仅伤了他的手，还伤了他的肩膀。但是鲨鱼迅速冲上来，头伸出水面，老人正中鲨鱼扁平头顶的中心猛击，当鲨鱼的鼻子伸出水面并贴在鱼身上时。老人收回刀片，再次准确地击中鲨鱼的同一位置。鲨鱼仍然咬住鱼，老人刺向它的左眼。鲨鱼仍然咬着。
“不行？”老人说着将刀片插入脊椎和脑之间。这次射击很轻松，他感到软骨被切断。老人翻转桨叶，将刀片放在鲨鱼的口中打开它们。他扭转刀片，当鲨鱼脱离时说道：“快走吧，加拉诺。滑到深处一英里。去看看你的朋友，或者可能是你的母亲。”
老人擦干刀片，放下桨。然后他找到了帆和船帆充满风，将小船调整到正确方向。
“它们一定拿走了他四分之一，还有最好的肉，”他大声说道。“我希望这只是一个梦，我从未钓到它。对不起，鱼。这让一切变得错了。”他停了下来，现在他不想看着这条鱼。失血并冲刷过的鱼现在看起来颜色像一枚硬币的背面，而它的条纹仍然清晰可见。
“我不应该走那么远，鱼，”他说。“不是为了你也不是为了我。对不起，鱼。”
现在，他对自己说。检查刀的绳索，看看有没有被割断。然后整理好你的手，因为还有更多的事情要发生。
“我希望有块石头来磨刀片，”老人在检查了桨的尾部绳索后说道。“我应该带块石头来的。”你应该带来很多东西，他想。但你没有带来。现在不是考虑你没有的东西的时候。考虑一下用手头现有的东西能做些什么吧。
“你给了我很多好建议，”他大声说道。“我已经厌倦了。”他将舵杆放在胳膊下，两只手都浸在水中，小船向前驶去。“只有上帝知道最后一击花了多少力量，”他说。
“但现在她轻了很多。”他不想想鱼的底部被肢解的样子。他知道鲨鱼每一次颠簸碰撞都是肉被撕裂，鱼现在留下的血迹就像一条大海洋中的高速公路一样宽。

他是一条能供给一个人整个冬天的鱼，他想。不要想那些。只要休息，并努力让手恢复好状态保护剩下的部分。现在我的手上的血腥味道已经无所谓了，因为水中的气味太重了。而且它们也不流很多血。没有任何有意义的切割。出血可能会防止手部抽筋。
我现在能想到什么？他想。什么也不能想。我必须什么也不想，等待...

the next ones. I wish it had really been a dream, he thought. But who knows? It might
have turned out well.
The next shark that came was a single shovelnose. He came like a pig to the trough if
a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it. The old man let him hit the
fish and then drove the knife on the oar don into his brain. But the shark jerked
backwards as he rolled and the knife blade snapped.
The old man settled himself to steer. He did not even watch the big shark sinking
slowly in the water, [111] showing first life-size, then small, then tiny. That always
fascinated the old man. But he did not even watch it now.
“I have the gaff now,” he said. “But it will do no good. I have the two oars and the
tiller and the short club.”
Now they have beaten me, he thought. I am too old to club sharks to death. But I will
try it as long as I have the oars and the short club and the tiller.
He put his hands in the water again to soak them. It was getting late in the afternoon
and he saw nothing but the sea and the sky. There was more wind in the sky than there
had been, and soon he hoped that he would see land.
“You’re tired, old man,” he said. “You’re tired inside.”
The sharks did not hit him again until just before sunset.
The old man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in
the water.
They were not even quartering on the scent. They were headed straight for the skiff
swimming side by side. He jammed the tiller, made the sheet fast and reached under the
stem for the club. It was an oar handle [112] from a broken oar sawed off to about two
and a half feet in length. He could only use it
effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold of
it with his right hand, flexing his hand on it, as he watched the sharks come. They were
both galanos.
I must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or
straight across the top of the head, he thought.
The two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and
sink them into the silver side of the fish, he raised the club high and brought it down
heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark’s broad head. He felt the rubbery solidity
as the club came down. But he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once
more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish.
The other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide. The
old man could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws
as he bumped the fish and closed his jaws. He swung at him and hit only the head and the
shark looked at him and wrenched the meat loose. The [113] old man swung the club

下一个来的鲨鱼是一只铲鼻鲨。如果一只猪有一个可以让你把头放进去的嘴巴，它就像一只猪来到槽前。老人让他抓住鱼，然后用桨上的刀刺入他的脑部。但是鲨鱼向后猛拉，刀刃折断了。

老人安顿好自己来驾驶。他甚至没有看着大鲨鱼在水中慢慢下沉，先是活生生的，然后是小的，然后是微小的。这总是吸引老人。但是他现在甚至都不看。

“我现在有钓竿了，”他说。“但没有用。我有两支桨、舵和短棍。”

现在他们已经打败我了，他想。我已经太老了，无法用棍子把鲨鱼打死。但只要我还拿着桨、短棍和舵，我会继续尝试。

他再次把手放进水里浸泡。下午已经很晚了，他只看到了海和天空。天空中的风比之前更大，他希望很快就能看到陆地。

“你累了，老人，”他说。“你内心已经疲惫。”

直到日落前，鲨鱼才再次袭击他。

老人看到那些褐色的鳍沿着鱼必定经过的宽广路径游来。

它们甚至没有在追踪味道。它们笔直向着小船游来，身旁游来游去。他推动舵，系好拉脚，在船头下伸手拿起短棍。它是一根破损桨的桨柄，锯成约两英尺半的长度。由于握柄的握力，他只能用一只手有效地使用它，并用右手紧紧握住它，看着鲨鱼游来。它们都是加拉诺斯。

我必须让第一个得到一个好的机会，击中它的鼻子或者直接打在头顶上，他想。

两只鲨鱼靠近在一起，当他看到最靠近他的那只张开嘴巴，咬住鱼的银色侧面时，他高高举起短棍，猛力砸在鲨鱼宽阔头部的顶端。他感受到短棍落下时的橡胶质感。但他也感受到了骨头的坚固，他再次重重击中鲨鱼鼻尖处，鲨鱼从鱼身滑落下来。

另一只鲨鱼先是进来又出去，现在又张开宽阔的嘴巴再次向前。老人看到鲨鱼嘴角飞溅出的白色肉块，当它碰到鱼并闭上嘴时。他挥向它，只击中了头部，鲨鱼看着他，扭动着将肉扯开。老人挥动短棍。

down on him again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid
rubberiness.
“Come on, galano,” the old man said. “Come in again.”
The shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws. He hit him
solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club. This time he felt the bone at the
base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat
loose sluggishly and slid down from the fish.
The old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed. Then he saw
one on the surface swimming in circles. He did not see the fin of the other.
I could not expect to kill them, he thought. I could have in my time. But I have hurt
them both badly and neither one can feel very good. If I could have used a bat with two
hands I could have killed the first one surely. Even now, he thought.
He did not want to look at the fish. He knew that half of him had been destroyed.
The sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks.
“It will be dark soon,” he said. “Then I should see [114] the glow of Havana.. If I am
too far to the eastward I will see the lights of one of the new beaches.”
I cannot be too far out now, he thought. I hope no one has been too worried. There is
only the boy to worry, of course. But I am sure he would have confidence. Many of the
older fishermen will worry. Many others too, he thought. I live in a good town.
He could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly.
Then something came into his head.
“Half fish,” he said. “Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too far out. I ruined
us both. But we have killed many sharks, you and I, and ruined many others. How many
did you ever kill, old fish? You do not have that spear on your head for nothing.”
He liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swimming
free. I should have chopped the bill off to fight them with, he thought. But there was no
hatchet and then there was no knife.
But if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon. Then we might
have fought them together. What will you do now if they come in the night? What can you
do?
“Fight them,” he said. “I’ll fight them until I die.”
[115] But in the dark now and no glow showing and no lights and only the wind and
the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was already dead. He put his two hands
together and felt the palms. They were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by
simply opening and closing them. He leaned his back against the stern and knew he was
not dead. His shoulders told him.
I have all those prayers I promised if I caught the fish, he thought. But I am too tired

又一次，鲨鱼向他游过来，老人挥动着棍子击中了他，准确地击中了他最高处。这一次，他感觉到了脑基底的骨头，并再次在同样的地方击中了他，而鲨鱼则慢吞吞地扯下了肉，从鱼身上滑了下来。
老人注视着鲨鱼，等待它再次出现，但没有一个鲨鱼露面。然后，他看到一个在水面上绕圈游动的鲨鱼，没有看到另一个的鳍。
我不能指望杀死它们，他想。以前我可以做到。但我已经严重伤害了它们两个，它们一个也不会感觉很好。如果我能用双手握住棍子，我肯定能杀死第一个。即使现在，他想。
他不想看着这条鱼。他知道它已经被毁坏了一半。
在和鲨鱼搏斗的过程中，太阳已经落山了。
“很快就要天黑了，”他说。“然后我应该看到哈瓦那的光芒。如果我漂得太远朝东了，我会看到其中一个新海滩的灯光。”
我现在应该不会漂得太远，他想。我希望没人太过担心。当然只有男孩需要担心。但我相信他会很有信心。很多老渔夫会感到担忧。其他很多人也会，他想。我住在一个好小镇。
因为鱼伤得太重，他再也无法和鱼说话了。
然后，一种感觉涌上心头。
“半条鱼，”他说。“你曾经是一条鱼。我很抱歉我漂得太远了。我毁了我们俩。但我们杀死了很多鲨鱼，你我都毁坏了许多其他鲨鱼。多少你曾经杀过，老鱼？你的头上的这根矛不是摆设的。”
他喜欢想象鱼儿自由游弋时对鲨鱼能做些什么。我本应该砍掉嘴巴与它们战斗，他想。但是没有斧头，也没有刀。
但如果我有斧头，能将它绑在桨桨上，那将是一把何等强大的武器。然后我们可能共同与它们战斗。如果它们半夜再来会怎样？你能做些什么？
“与它们战斗，”他说。“我会战斗直至死亡。”
然而现在在黑暗中，没有光芒，没有灯光，只有风声和风帆的持续拉扯，他感到或许自己已经死了。他合拢双手，感受着手掌。它们还没有死，通过简单的打开和闭合他能感知到生命的痛苦。他靠在船尾上，知道自己还活着。他的肩膀告诉他。
我承诺捕到鱼时要念的所有祈祷，他想。但我太累了。

to say them now. I better get the sack and put it over my shoulders.
He lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky. I have
half of him, he thought. Maybe I’ll have the luck to bring the forward half in. I should
have some luck. No, he said. You violated your luck when you went too far outside.
“Don’t be silly,” he said aloud. “And keep awake and steer. You may have much luck
yet.”
“I’d like to buy some if there’s any place they sell it,” he said.
What could I buy it with? he asked himself. Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a
broken knife and two bad hands?
“You might,” he said. “You tried to buy it with [116] eighty-four days at sea. They
nearly sold it to you too.”
I must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and
who can recognize her? I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked. I
wish I could see the glow from the lights, he thought. I wish too many things. But that is
the thing I wish for now. He tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain he
knew he was not dead.
He saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten
o’clock at night. They were only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the
moon rises. Then they were steady to see across the ocean which was rough now with the
increasing breeze. He steered inside of the glow and he thought that now, soon, he must
hit the edge of the stream.
Now it is over, he thought. They will probably hit me again. But what can a man do
against them in the dark without a weapon?
He was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body
hurt with the cold of the night. I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought. I hope so
much I do not have to fight again.
[117] But by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless. They
came in a pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their
phosphorescence as they threw themselves on the fish. He clubbed at heads and heard
the jaws chop and the shaking of the skiff as they took hold below. He clubbed
desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it
was gone.
He jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it, holding it in
both hands and driving it down again and again. But they were up to the bow now and
driving in one after the other and together, tearing off the pieces of meat that showed
glowing below the sea as they turned to come once more.
One came, finally, against the head itself and he knew that it was over. He swung the
tiller across the shark’s head where the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fish’s

现在说这些话是最好的。我最好把袋子拿过来披在肩上。
他躺在船尾，掌舵，看着天空中的微光。我得到了他的一半，他想道。也许我会有幸运把前半部分带回来。我应该会有一些运气。不，他说。当你走得太远时，你已经违背了你的运气。
“别傻了，”他大声说道。“保持清醒，掌舵。你可能还会有很多运气的。”
“如果有人卖的话，我想买一些，”他说。
我能用什么来买呢？他问自己。我能用一个丢失的鱼叉和一个破损的刀和两只不好的手来买吗？
“可能”，他说。“你试图用八十四天的海上生活去换取它。他们几乎也卖给了你。”
我不能想些废话，他想道。运气是一种多样的形式，谁又能认出她呢？无论以什么形式，我都愿意得到一些，并支付他们要求的代价。他希望自己能看到灯光的光辉，他想道。我也有很多愿望。但现在我最希望的就是这个。他试图更加舒适地掌舵，并从疼痛中知道自己还没有死。

他看到了城市灯光的反射光，在晚上十点左右。起初，它们只能被感觉到，就像月亮升起前天空中的光一样。然后它们稳定下来，可以看到在海洋上方，海面现在已经因为逐渐增强的风而波涛汹涌。他掌舵朝光辉的方向航行，并想，现在，很快，他必须撞上洋流的边缘了。

现在结束了，他想道。他们可能会再次袭击我。但在黑暗中一个人没有武器能做些什么呢？

他现在又僵硬又酸痛，他身体的所有受伤和紧张的地方因夜间的寒冷而疼。我希望不用再打架，他想道。我非常希望我不必再打架。

但到了午夜，他又开始打架了，这一次他知道这场战斗是无用的。他们成群而来，他只能看到它们的鳍划过水面并且它们的发光，在鱼身上扑向它们时。他用船桨敲打着它们的头颅，听到牙齿咬碎和船艇的震动，因为它们在下面抓住鱼。他拼命地用船桨敲打着只能感觉和听到的东西，他感到有什么东西抓住了船桨，然后它消失了。

他将舵杆从船舵上挣脱下来，用力挥动着，持续不断地敲打。但它们现在已经来到船头，一起挤了进来，撕下了在海底发光的肉块。他们转身再次扑向鱼时，一起乱撕着肉。

最后一只来到了头部，他知道一切都结束了。他将舵杆挥向鲨鱼的头部，在那里它的下颚被卡住在鱼头的沉重处无法撕裂。他挥动了一次、两次，再次挥动。他听到舵杆...

break and he lunged at the shark with the splintered butt. He felt it go in and knowing it
was sharp he drove it in again. The shark let go and rolled away. That was the [118] last
shark of the pack that came. There was nothing more for them to eat.
The old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth. It
was coppery and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment. But there was not much of
it.
He spat into the ocean and said, “Eat that, galanos. And make a dream you’ve killed
a man.”
He knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back to the
stern and found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough
for him to steer. He settled the sack around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course.
He sailed lightly now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind. He was past
everything now and he sailed the skiff to make his home port as well and as intelligently
as he could. In the night sharks hit the carcass as someone might pick up crumbs from
the table. The old man paid no attention to them and did not pay any attention to
anything except steering. He only noticed how lightly and bow well the skiff sailed now
there was no great weight beside her.
[119] She’s good, he thought. She is sound and not harmed in any way except for the
tiller. That is easily replaced. He could feel he was inside the current now and he could
see the lights of the beach colonies along the shore. He knew where he was now and it
was nothing to get home.
The wind is our friend, anyway, he thought. Then he added, sometimes. And the
great sea with our friends and our enemies. And bed, he thought. Bed is my friend. Just
bed, he thought. Bed will be a great thing. It is easy when you are beaten, he thought. I
never knew how easy it was. And what beat you, he thought.
“Nothing,” he said aloud. “I went out too far.”
When he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the Terrace were out and he knew
everyone was in bed. The breeze had risen steadily and was blowing strongly now. It was
quiet in the harbour though and he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the
rocks. There was no one to help him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could. Then he
stepped out and made her fast to a rock.
[120] He unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it. Then he shouldered the
mast and started to climb. It was then he knew the depth of his tiredness. He stopped for
a moment and looked back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of
the fish standing up well behind the skiff’s stern. He saw the white naked line of his
backbone and the dark mass of the head with the projecting bill and all the nakedness
between.
He started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast
across his shoulder. He tried to get up. But it was too difficult and he sat there with the
mast on his shoulder and looked at the road. A cat passed on the far side going about its
business and the old man watched it. Then he just watched the road.

半截破裂，他冲向鲨鱼。他感觉刺入了鲨鱼，知道它很锋利，再次将它刺进去。鲨鱼松开了口，滚开了。那是最后一只过来的鲨鱼。它们没有其他可以吃的东西了。
老人现在几乎喘不过气来，口中有一种奇怪的味道。味道带铜味又甜，他一时有些害怕。但并不多。
他向海洋吐了口唾沫，说道：“吃吧，加拉诺斯。让你做梦杀了一个人。”
他知道自己现在最终被打败了，无药可救，于是他回到船尾，发现舵柄的破碎末端恰好可以插入船舵的槽中，让他能够操舵。他在肩上调整好麻袋，让小船保持方向。现在他轻盈地航行，没有任何想法，也没有任何感觉。他已经超越了一切，尽力以最聪明的方式让小船回到港口。夜间，鲨鱼袭击尸体，犹如有人拾起桌子上的碎屑。老人不理会它们，只专心操舵。他只注意到小船航行起来是多么轻巧，多么顺畅，旁边没有庞大的重物了。
“她很好，”他想。“她完好无损，除了舵。舵容易替换。”他感觉到自己现在在洋流中，可以看到沿岸沙滩上的灯光。他现在知道自己在哪里，回家并不难。
风依然是我们的朋友，他想。然后他补充道，有时候。大海是我们的朋友和敌人。床，他想。床是我的朋友。只有床，他想。床将是一件伟大的事情。当你被打败时，这很容易，他想。我从来不知道这有多容易。是什么打败了你，他想。
“没有什么，”他大声说。“我出海太远了。”
当他驶入小港口时，露台的灯已经熄灭，他知道所有人都已经上床睡觉了。微风渐起，现在刮得很强。港口里很安静，他驶到了岩石下方的一小块碎石上。没有人帮助他，所以他尽可能地把船拉上岸边。然后他踏出船桅，收起帆，系好。然后他扛起船桅开始攀岩。这时他才意识到自己有多么疲惫。他停下来看了一会儿，看到街灯的反光中，小船船尾后面耸立起的巨大鱼尾。他看到白皮肉直到尾鳍和漆黑的头部，显露出长长的喙和所有裸露的部分。
他又开始攀登，到达顶部时摔倒，躺了一会儿，船桅斜靠在肩上。他试图站起来，但太困难了，于是他就坐在那里，肩上扛着船桅，望着道路。一只猫从远处经过，办着自己的事情，老人看着它。然后他只是注视着道路。

Finally he put the mast down and stood up. He picked the mast up and put it on his
shoulder and started up the road. He had to sit down five times before he reached his
shack.
Inside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall. In the dark he found a water
bottle and took a drink. Then he lay down on the bed. He pulled the blanket [121] over his
shoulders and then over his back and legs and he slept face down on the newspapers with
his arms out straight and the palms of his hands up.
He was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning. It was blowing so
hard that the drifting-boats would not be going out and the boy had slept late and then
come to the old man’s shack as he had come each morning. The boy saw that the old man
was breathing and then he saw the old man’s hands and he started to cry. He went out
very quietly to go to bring some coffee and all the way down the road he was crying.
Many fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside it and one
was in the water, his trousers rolled up, measuring the skeleton with a length of line.
The boy did not go down. He had been there before and one of the fishermen was
looking after the skiff for him. “How is he?” one of the fishermen shouted. “Sleeping,” the
boy called. He did not care that they saw him crying. “Let no one disturb him.” “He was
eighteen feet from nose to tail,” the fisherman who was measuring him called.
[122] “I believe it,” the boy said.
He went into the Terrace and asked for a can of coffee.
“Hot and with plenty of milk and sugar in it.”
“Anything more?”
“No. Afterwards I will see what he can eat.”
“What a fish it was,” the proprietor said. “There has never been such a fish. Those
were two fine fish you took yesterday too.” “Damn my fish,” the boy said and he started to
cry again.
“Do you want a drink of any kind?” the proprietor asked.
“No,” the boy said. “Tell them not to bother Santiago. I’ll be back.”
“Tell him how sorry I am.”
“Thanks,” the boy said.
The boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man’s shack and sat by him until
he woke. Once it looked as though he were waking. But he had gone back into heavy sleep
and the boy had gone across the road to borrow some wood to heat the coffee.
Finally the old man woke.
[123] “Don’t sit up,” the boy said. “Drink this.”

进入小屋后，他把桅杆靠在墙边。在黑暗中，他找到了一个水瓶喝了一口。然后他躺在床上。他把毯子盖在肩膀上，然后盖住背部和腿部，面朝下躺在报纸上，双臂伸直，手掌朝上。
早晨，男孩看着门口进去时，他已经睡着了。风刮得很厉害，漂流船根本无法出去，男孩睡得很晚，然后像每天早上一样来到老人的小屋。男孩看到老人在呼吸，然后看到老人的手，他开始哭了。他非常安静地出去给老人带来一些咖啡，一路上他都在哭。
许多渔民围着小船，看着系在小船旁边的东西，其中一个人在水里，裤子卷起来，用一根长度线测量骨架。男孩没有下去。他以前来过，渔民中的一个人正在照看小船。“他怎么样？”一个渔民喊道。“在睡觉，”男孩喊道。他并不在乎他们看到他哭。“不要打扰他。”“从鼻子到尾巴有十八英尺长，”正在测量的渔民说道。“我相信，”男孩说道。
他走进露台，要了一罐咖啡。“热的，里面加足够的牛奶和糖。”“还要别的吗？”“不，之后我会看看他能吃些什么。”“那条鱼真是厉害，”店主说。“从来没有过这样的鱼。昨天你捕了两条好鱼。”“讨厌我的鱼，”男孩说，然后他又开始哭了。“你想要喝点什么吗？”店主问。“不，”男孩说。“告诉他们不要打扰圣地亚哥。我会返回的。”“告诉他我多么抱歉。”“谢谢，”男孩说。
男孩端着热咖啡罐上去老人的小屋，坐在他身边直到他醒来。有一次看起来他醒了。但他又重新进入沉睡，男孩走过马路借了些木头来热咖啡。
最终，老人醒了。“不要坐起来，”男孩说。“喝这个。”

He poured some of the coffee in a glass.
The old man took it and drank it.
“They beat me, Manolin,” he said. “They truly beat me.”
“He didn’t beat you. Not the fish.”
“No. Truly. It was afterwards.”
“Pedrico is looking after the skiff and the gear. What do you want done with the
head?”
“Let Pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps.”
“And the spear?”
“You keep it if you want it.”
“I want it,” the boy said. “Now we must make our plans about the other things.”
“Did they search for me?”
“Of course. With coast guard and with planes.”
“The ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see,” the old man said. He
noticed how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to instead of speaking only to
himself and to the sea. “I missed you,” he said. “What did you catch?” “One the first day.
One the second and two the third.”
[124] “Very good.”
“Now we fish together again.”
“No. I am not lucky. I am not lucky anymore.”
“The hell with luck,” the boy said. “I’ll bring the luck with me.”
“What will your family say?”
“I do not care. I caught two yesterday. But we will fish together now for I still have
much to learn.”
“We must get a good killing lance and always have it on board. You can make the
blade from a spring leaf from an old Ford. We can grind it in Guanabacoa. It should be
sharp and not tempered so it will break. My knife broke.”
“I’ll get another knife and have the spring ground.”
How many days of heavy brisa have we?”
“Maybe three. Maybe more.”
“I will have everything in order,” the boy said. “You get your hands well old man.”

老人拿起来喝了一口。
“他们打败了我，曼奥林，”他说。“他们确实打败了我。”
“不是鱼打败了你，”曼奥林说。
“不，真的。是事后的事。”
“佩德里科在照看渔船和装备。你想怎么处理鱼头？”
“让佩德里科把它剁碎，用来做鱼笼。”
“还有那支矛？”
“如果你想要就留着吧。”
“我想要，”男孩说。“现在我们必须安排好其他的事情。”
“他们有没有找我？”
“当然有。用海岸警卫队和飞机。”
“海很大，一条小渔船很难被发现，”老人说。他意识到能有人和他交谈是多么愉快，不再只是自言自语和与海说话。“我想你了，”他说。“你们捕到了什么？” “第一天一个。
第二天一个，第三天两个。”
“很好。”
“现在我们再一起钓鱼。”
“不，我没那么幸运了。我再也不幸运了。”
“去他的运气，”男孩说。“我会带来好运的。”
“你家人会怎么说？”
“我不在乎。昨天我捕到了两条。但现在我们将一起钓鱼，因为我还有很多东西要学。”
“我们必须弄一支好的杀伤长矛，永远放在船上。你可以用一片老式福特车的弹簧叶片制作刀片。我们可以在关那瓜博科磨利。磨得锋利但不要经过温度处理，否则会断。我的刀断了。”

“I know how to care for them. In the night I spat something strange and felt
something in my chest was broken.” “Get that well too,” the boy said. “Lie down, old man,
and I will bring you your clean shirt. And something to eat.”
[125] “Bring any of the papers of the time that I was gone,” the old man said.
“You must get well fast for there is much that I can learn and you can teach me
everything.
How much did you suffer?” “Plenty,” the old man said.
“I’ll bring the food and the papers,” the boy said. “Rest well, old man. I will bring
stuff from the drugstore for your hands.”
“Don’t forget to tell Pedrico the head is his.”
“No. I will remember.”
As the boy went out the door and down the worn coral rock road he was crying again.
That afternoon there was a party of tourists at the Terrace and looking down in the
water among the empty beer cans and dead barracudas a woman saw a great long white
spine with a huge tail at the end that lifted and swung with the tide while the east wind
blew a heavy steady sea outside the entrance to the harbour.
“What’s that?” she asked a waiter and pointed to the long backbone of the great fish
that was now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide.
“Tiburon,” the waiter said. “Shark.” He was meaning to explain what had happened.
“I didn’t know sharks had such handsome, beautifully formed tails.”
“I didn’t either,” her male companion said.
Up the road, in his shack, the old man was sleeping again. He was still sleeping on
his face and the boy was sitting by him watching him. The old man was dreaming about
the lions.

“我会拿食物和报纸来的，”男孩说。“好好休息，老人。我去药店给你买一些护手用的东西。”

“不要忘记告诉Pedrico鱼头是他的。”“不会的，我会记住的。”

男孩走出门，沿着磨损的珊瑚岩石路往下走，他再次哭了起来。那天下午在露台上有一群游客，他们往下看，看到水里满是空啤酒罐和死去的梭鱼，一名女子看到了一条长长的白色脊椎骨，末端有一个巨大的尾巴，在潮汐的摆动中随风摇摆，而东风在港口入口处吹着汹涌的大海。

“那是什么？”她问一个务生，指着那条如今只是等待被潮水冲走的大鱼的长脊椎。“Tiburon，”务生说。“鲨鱼。”他本来想解释发生了什么。“我不知道鲨鱼拥有如此漂亮，优美的尾巴。”“我也不知道，”她的男伴说。

在屋外的小屋里，老人再次睡着了。他仍然趴着睡觉，男孩坐在他旁边观察着他。老人正在做关于狮子的梦。

Ernest Hemingway, Writer
• Born: 21 July 1899
• Birthplace: Oak Park, Illinois
• Died: 2 July 1961 (suicide)
• Best Known As: Famously manly author of For Whom the Bell
Tolls
Hemingway is one of the 20th century's most famous American writers. His
books include The Sun Also Rises (1926), A Farewell to Arms (1929), and For
Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Hemingway's plainspoken no-frills writing style
became so famous that it was (and is) frequently parodied. His dashing
machismo was almost as famous as his writing: he lived in Paris, Cuba and Key
West, fancied bullfighting and big game hunting, and served as a war
correspondent in WWII and the Spanish Civil War. He sealed his own notoriety
when he killed himself with a shotgun in 1961.
Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954...
Hemingway is sometimes called by his familiar nickname "Papa"... His
birthdate is sometimes listed in error as 1898. According to a 1954 article in the
New York Times, "In most reference books and in his own conversation he is
one year older because he gave 1898 as his birth date when he tried to enlist [in
the army] early in 1917, and stuck to that date ever since"... Hemingway's father
also committed suicide, shooting himself with a Civil War pistol in 1928.

• 出生地：伊利诺伊州奥克帕克
• 逝世日期：1961年7月2日（自杀）
• 最著名作品：《为谁的钟声而鸣》
海明威是20世纪最著名的美国作家之一。他的著作包括《太阳照常升起》（1926年）、《告别武器》（1929年）和《为谁的钟声而鸣》（1940年）。海明威那种直接无华的写作风格变得如此著名，以至于经常被人模仿。他的英姿飒爽几乎和他的写作一样出名：他曾在巴黎、古巴和基韦斯特居住，喜欢斗牛和打猎，担任过二战和西班牙内战的战地记者。他在1961年用一支霰弹枪结束了自己的生命，从而留下了自己的坏名声。
海明威于1954年获得诺贝尔文学奖...
海明威有时被人称为他熟悉的昵称“爸爸”... 有时他的生日会错误地列为1898年。根据1954年《纽约时报》的一篇文章，“在大多数参考书和他自己的谈话中，他都比实际年龄大一岁，因为1917年早些时候他试图入伍[参军]时给出了1898年的出生日期，从那时起一直坚持保持这个日期”... 海明威的父亲也自杀，于1928年用一支内战手枪自杀。

The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway
www.Asiaing.com
To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

“I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”
“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”
“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
“He hasn’t much faith.”
[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”
“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff
home.”
“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he
was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did
not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted
their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful
fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried
them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

“I remember everything from when we first went together.”
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’s
and your mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.”
“May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.”
“I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.”
“Let me get four fresh ones.”
“One,” the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they
were freshening as when the breeze rises.
“Two,” the boy said.
“Two,” the old man agreed. “You didn’t steal them?”
“I would,” the boy said. “But I bought these.”
“Thank you,” the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained
humility. But he [13] knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it
carried no loss of true pride.
“Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,” he said.
“Where are you going?” the boy asked.
“Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.”
“I’ll try to get him to work far out,” the boy said. “Then if you hook something truly
big we can come to your aid.”
“He does not like to work too far out.”
“No,” the boy said. “But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird
working and get
him to come out after dolphin.” “Are his eyes that bad?” “He is almost blind.” “It is
strange,” the old man said. “He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes.” “But
you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.”
“I am a strange old man”
“But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?”
“I think so. And there are many tricks.”
[14] “Let us take the stuff home,” the boy said. “So I can get the cast net and go after
the sardines.”
They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder

and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff
and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff
along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought
alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the
heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local
people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were
needless temptations to leave in a boat.
They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its
open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the
boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room
of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are
called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to
cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy
fibered [15] guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another
of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted
photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too
lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked.
“A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?”
“No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?”
“No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.”
“May I take the cast net?”
“Of course.”
There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went
through
this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this
too. “Eighty-five is a lucky number,” the old man said. “How would you like to see me
bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?” “I’ll get the cast net and go for
sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?”
[16] “Yes. I have yesterday’s paper and I will read the baseball.” The boy did not
know whether yesterday’s paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from
under the bed.
“Perico gave it to me at the bodega,” he explained. “I’ll be back when I have the
sardines. I’ll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.
When I come back you can tell me about the baseball.”
“The Yankees cannot lose.”
“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.”

“Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio.”
“I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland.”
“Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sax of
Chicago.”
“You study it and tell me when I come back.”
“Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow
is the
eighty-fifth day.” “We can do that,” the boy said. “But what about the eighty-seven of
your great record?”
[17] “It could not happen twice. Do you think you can find an eighty-five?”
“I can order one.
“One sheet. That’s two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?”
“That’s easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half.”
“I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg.”
“Keep warm old man,” the boy said. “Remember we are in September.”
“The month when the great fish come,” the old man said. “Anyone can be a
fisherman in May.”
“I go now for the sardines,” the boy said.
When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down.
The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and
over the old man’s shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very
old, and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old
man was asleep and his head fallen forward. His shirt had been patched so many times
that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun.
The [18] old man’s head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in
his face. The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the
evening breeze. He was barefooted.
The boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep.
“Wake up old man,” the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man’s knees.
The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way
away. Then he smiled.
“What have you got?” he asked.
“Supper,” said the boy. “We’re going to have supper.”

“I’m not very hungry.”
“Come on and eat. You can’t fish and not eat.”
“I have,” the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it. Then
he started to fold the blanket.
“Keep the blanket around you,” the boy said. “You’ll not fish without eating while I’m
alive.”
“Then live a long time and take care of yourself,” the old man said. “What are we
eating?”
“Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew.”
[19] The boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the Terrace.
The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin
wrapped around each set.
“Who gave this to you?”
“Martin. The owner.”
“I must thank him.”
“I thanked him already,” the boy said. “You don’t need to thank him.”
“I’ll give him the belly meat of a big fish,” the old man said. “Has he done this for us
more than once?”
“I think so.”
“I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is very thoughtful for
us.”
“He sent two beers.”
“I like the beer in cans best.”
“I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the bottles.”
“That’s very kind of you,” the old man said. “Should we eat?”
“I’ve been asking you to,” the boy told him gently. “I have not wished to open the
container until you were ready.”
[20] “I’m ready now,” the old man said. “I only needed time to wash.”
Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was two streets
down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good
towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter
and some sort of shoes and another blanket.

“Your stew is excellent,” the old man said.
“Tell me about the baseball,” the boy asked him.
“In the American League it is the Yankees as I said,” the old man said happily.”
“They lost today,” the boy told him.
“That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again.”
“They have other men on the team.”
“Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between Brooklyn and
Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives
In the old park.”
“There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen.”
“Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace?”
[21] “I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to
ask him and you were too timid.” “I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone
with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives.” “I would like to take the great
DiMaggio fishing,” the old man said. “They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was
as poor as we are and would understand.” “The great Sisler’s father was never poor and
he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age.” “When I was your
age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I
have seen lions on the beaches in the evening.”
“I know. You told me.”
“Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?”
“Baseball I think,” the boy said. “Tell me about the great John J. McGraw.” He said
Jota for J.
“He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough
and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as
baseball. At least he carried lists of [22] horses at all times in his pocket and frequently
spoke the names of horses on the telephone.”
“He was a great manager,” the boy said. “My father thinks he was the greatest.”
“Because he came here the most times,” the old man said. “If Durocher had
continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager.”
“Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?”
“I think they are equal.”
“And the best fisherman is you.”

“No. I know others better.”
“Que Va,” the boy said. “There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But
there is only you.”
“Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will
prove us wrong.”
“There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say.”
“I may not be as strong as I think,” the old man said. “But I know many tricks and I
have resolution.” “You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I
will take the things back to the Terrace.”
[23] “Good night then. I will wake you in the morning.”
“You’re my alarm clock,” the boy said.
“Age is my alarm clock,” the old man said. “Why do old men wake so early? Is it to
have one longer day?”
“I don’t know,” the boy said. “All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard.”
“I can remember it,” the old man said. “I’ll waken you in time.”
“I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior.”
“I know.”
“Sleep well old man.”
The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off
his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow,
putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the
other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.
He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the
long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high
capes and the great brown mountains. He lived along that coast now every night and in
his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats [24] come riding through it.
He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa
that the land breeze brought at morning.
Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the
boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early
in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the
sea and then he dreamed of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.
He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of
great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places
now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved
them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out
the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated

outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy. He was shivering with the
morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be
rowing.
The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and
walked in quietly with his [25] bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and
the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He
took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him.
The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting
on the bed, pulled them on.
The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the
old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, “I am sorry.”
“Qua Va,” the boy said. “It is what a man must do.”
They walked down the road to the old man’s shack and all along the road, in the dark,
barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.
When they reached the old man’s shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket
and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his
shoulder.
“Do you want coffee?” the boy asked.
“We’ll put the gear in the boat and then get some.”
They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served
fishermen.
“How did you sleep old man?” the boy asked. He [26] was waking up now although it
was still hard for him to leave his sleep.
“Very well, Manolin,” the old man said. “I feel confident today.”
“So do I,” the boy said. “Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits.
He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything.”
“We’re different,” the old man said. “I let you carry things when you were five years
old.”
“I know it,” the boy said. “I’ll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit
here.”
He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were
stored.
The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew
that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a
lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the
day.

The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper
and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and
lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.
[27] “Good luck old man.”
“Good luck,” the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole
pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row
out of the harbour in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going out
to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see
them now the moon was below the hills.
Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except
for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour
and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man
knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the
clean early morning smell of the ocean. He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in
the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well
because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish
congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of
the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools
of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the
wandering fish fed on them.
In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the
trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made
as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his
principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate
dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought,
the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong
ones. Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean
can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so
suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are
made too delicately for the sea.
He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when
they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always
said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys
as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought [29] when the shark livers had
brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a
contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as
feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or
wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a
woman, he thought.
He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his
speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current.
He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he
was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.

I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I’ll work out
where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them.
Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. One bait
was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were
down in the blue
water at one [30] hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait
hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and
all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh
sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on
the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was
not sweet smelling and good tasting.
The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two
deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow
jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the
excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a
big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait
would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made
fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three
hundred fathoms of line.
Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed
gently to keep the [31] lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite
light and any moment now the sun would rise.
The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on
the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was
brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back
at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down
into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water.
He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the
stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that
swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty
fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.
But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who
knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather
be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.
The sun was two hours higher now and it did not [32] hurt his eyes so much to look
into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far
inshore.
All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the
evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the
evening too. But in the morning it is painful.
Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky
ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then

circled again.
“He’s got something,” the old man said aloud. “He’s not just looking.”
He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry
and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he
was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to
use the bird.
The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. Then he dove
suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over
the surface.
[33] “Dolphin,” the old man said aloud. “Big dolphin.”
He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire
leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go
over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line
and left it coiled in the shade of the bow. He went back to rowing and to watching the
long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water.
As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then
swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could
see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping
fish. The dolphin were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be
in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped. It is a big school of dolphin, he
thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has no
chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.
He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements
of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too
fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up [34] a stray and perhaps my big fish is around
them. My big fish must be somewhere.
The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long
green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that
it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in
the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them
go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton
because it meant fish. The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was
higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird
was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some
patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent,
gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating dose beside the boat. It turned on
its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple
filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.
“Agua mala,” the man said. “You whore.”
From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw

the tiny fish that [35] were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them
and under the small shade the bubble made as it drifted. They were immune to its poison.
But men were not and when same of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there
slimy and purple while the old man was working a fish, he would have welts and sores on
his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak can give. But these
poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash.
The iridescent bubbles were beautiful. But they were the falsest thing in the sea and
the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating them. The turtles saw them,
approached them from the front, then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced
and ate them filaments and all. The old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he
loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on
them with the horny soles of his feet.
He loved green turtles and hawk-bills with their elegance and speed and their great
value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their
armour-plating, strange in their [36] love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese
men-of-war with their eyes shut.
He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many
years. He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff
and weighed a ton. Most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle’s heart will
beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered. But the old man thought, I have
such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs. He ate the white eggs to give
himself strength. He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for
the truly big fish.
He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where
many of the fishermen kept their gear. It was there for all fishermen who wanted it. Most
fishermen hated the taste. But it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose
and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes.
Now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.
“He’s found fish,” he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no
scattering of bait [37] fish. But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air,
turned and dropped head first into the water. The tuna shone silver in the sun and after
he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in
all directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait. They were
circling it and driving it.
If they don’t travel too fast I will get into them, the old man thought, and he watched
the school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait
fish that were forced to the surface in their panic.
“The bird is a great help,” the old man said. Just then the stern line came taut under
his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt tile weight
of the small tuna’s shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in.
The shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the
water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat. He

lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring
as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering
strokes of his neat, fast-moving [38] tail. The old man hit him on the head for kindness
and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern.
“Albacore,” he said aloud. “He’ll make a beautiful bait. He’ll weigh ten pounds.”
He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself.
He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes
when he was alone steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats. He had
probably started to talk aloud, when alone, when the boy had left. But he did not
remember. When he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was
necessary. They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad weather. It was
considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had always
considered it so and respected it. But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since
there was no one that they could annoy.
“If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy,” he said
aloud. “But since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in
their boats and to bring them the baseball.”
[39] Now is no time to think of baseball, he thought. Now is the time to think of only
one thing. That which I was born for. There might be a big one around that school, he
thought. I picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding. But they are
working far out and fast. Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and
to the north-east. Can that be the time of day? Or is it some sign of weather that I do not
know?
He could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that
showed white as though they were snow-capped and the clouds that looked like high
snow mountains above them. The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the
water. The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was
only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines
going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.
The tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished
among them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for
baits, were down again. The sun was [40] hot now and the old man felt it on the back of
his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back as he rowed.
I could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake
me. But today is eighty-five days and I should fish the day well.
Just then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.
“Yes,” he said. “Yes,” and shipped his oars without bumping the boat. He reached out
for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. He felt
no strain nor weight and he held the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a
tentative pull, not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred
fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and the shank of

the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head of the small tuna.
The old man held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand, unleashed it from
the stick. Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension.
This far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought. Eat them, fish. Eat them.
Please eat them.
[41] How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the
dark. Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them. He felt the light
delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine’s head must have been more
difficult to break from the hook. Then there was nothing.
“Come on,” the old man said aloud. “Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren’t they
lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don’t be
shy, fish. Eat them.”
He waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it and the other
lines at the same time for the fish might have swum up or down. Then came the same
delicate pulling touch again.
“He’ll take it,” the old man said aloud. “God help him to take it.”
He did not take it though. He was gone and the old man felt nothing.
“He can’t have gone,” he said. “Christ knows he can’t have gone. He’s making a turn.
Maybe he
has been hooked before and he remembers something of it.
[42] Then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy.
“It was only his turn,” he said. “He’ll take it.”
He was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and
unbelievably heavy. It was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down, down,
down, unrolling off the first of the two reserve coils. As it went down, slipping lightly
through the old man’s fingers, he still could feel the great weight, though the pressure of
his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible. “What a fish,” he said. “He has it
sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it.”
Then he will turn and swallow it, he thought. He did not say that because he knew
that if you said a good thing it might not happen. He knew what a huge fish this was and
he thought of him moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his
mouth. At that moment he felt him stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the
weight increased and he gave more line. He tightened the pressure of his thumb and
finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going straight down.
[43] “He’s taken it,” he said. “Now I’ll let him eat it well.”
He let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and
made fast the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the
next line. Now he was ready. He had three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as

well as the coil he was using.
“Eat it a little more,” he said. “Eat it well.”
Eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you, he thought.
Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you. All right. Are you ready? Have you
been long enough at table?
“Now!” he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of line and
then struck again and again, swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the
strength of his arms and the pivoted weight of his body.
Nothing happened. The fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise
him an inch. His line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his hack
until it was so taut that beads of water were jumping from it. Then it began to make a
slow hissing sound in the water and he still held it, bracing [44] himself against the
thwart and leaning back against the pull. The boat began to move slowly off toward the
north-west.
The fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water. The other baits
were still in the water but there was nothing to be done.
“I wish I had the boy” the old man said aloud. “I’m being towed by a fish and I’m the
towing bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I
can and give him line when he must have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going
down.”
What I will do if he decides to go down, I don’t know. What I’ll do if he sounds and
dies I don’t know. But I’ll do something. There are plenty of things I can do.
He held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff
moving steadily to the north-west.
This will kill him, the old man thought. He can’t do this forever. But four hours later
the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old man was still
braced solidly with the line across his back.
[45] “It was noon when I hooked him,” he said. “And I have never seen him.”
He had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it
was cutting his forehead. He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being
careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the
water bottle with one hand. He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the
bow. He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to
endure.
Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible. That makes no
difference, he thought. I can always come in on the glow from Havana. There are two
more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will come up before that. If he doesn’t
maybe he will come up with the moon. If he does not do that maybe he will come up with
the sunrise. I have no cramps and I feel strong. It is he that has the hook in his mouth.

But what a fish to pull like that. He must have his mouth shut tight on the wire. I wish I
could see him. I wish I could see him only once to know what I have against me.
The fish never changed his course nor his direction [46] all that night as far as the
man could tell from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the old
man’s sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs. During the day he had
taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry. After the sun
went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back and he
cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now. The sack
cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he
was almost comfortable. The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he
thought of it as almost comfortable.
I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought. Not as long as
he keeps this up.
Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and
checked his course. The line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight
out from his shoulders. They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was
not so strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward. If I lose
the glare of Havana we must be going more to the eastward, he thought. For if the fish’s
course held true I must see it for many more [47] hours. I wonder how the baseball came
out in the grand leagues today, he thought. It would be wonderful to do this with a radio.
Then he thought, think of it always. Think of what you are doing. You must do nothing
stupid.
Then he said aloud, “I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this.”
No one should be alone in their old age, he thought. But it is unavoidable. I must
remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong. Remember, no matter
how little you want to, that you must eat him in the morning. Remember, he said to
himself.
During the night two porpoises came around the boat and he could hear them rolling
and blowing. He could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male made and
the sighing blow of the female.
“They are good,” he said. “They play and make jokes and love one another. They are
our brothers like the flying fish.”
Then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked. He is wonderful and strange
and who knows how old he is, he thought. Never have I had such a strong fish nor one
who acted so strangely. Perhaps he is too wise to jump. He could ruin me by jumping or
[48] by a wild rush. But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows
that this is how he should make his fight. He cannot know that it is only one man against
him, nor that it is an old man. But what a great fish he is and what will he bring in the
market if the flesh is good. He took the bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his
fight has no panic in it. I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as desperate as I am?
He remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin. The male fish

always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the female, made a wild,
panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon exhausted her, and all the time the male had
stayed with her, crossing the line and circling with her on the surface. He had stayed so
close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a
scythe and almost of that size and shape. When the old man had gaffed her and clubbed
her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and dubbing her across the top of her
head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then, with
the boy’s aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat. Then,
while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, [49] the male fish
jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down
deep, his lavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide
lavender stripes showing. He was beautiful, the old man remembered, and he had stayed.
That was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought. The boy was
sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly.
“I wish the boy was here,” he said aloud and settled himself against the rounded
planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his
shoulders moving steadily toward whatever he had chosen.
When once, through my treachery, it had been necessary to him to make a choice,
the old man thought.
His choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and
traps and treacheries. My choice was to go there to find him beyond all people. Beyond all
people in the world. Now we are joined together and have been since noon. And no one to
help either one of us.
Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought. But that was the thing that
I was born for. I must surely remember to eat the tuna after it gets light.
[50] Some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were behind
him. He heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff.
In the darkness he loosened his sheath knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his
left shoulder he leaned back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale. Then he
cut the other line closest to him and in the dark made the loose ends of the reserve coils
fast. He worked skillfully with the one hand and put his foot on the coils to hold them as
he drew his knots tight. Now he had six reserve coils of line. There were two from each
bait he had severed and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all
connected.
After it is light, he thought, I will work back to the forty-fathom bait and cut it away
too and link up the reserve coils. I will have lost two hundred fathoms of good Catalan
cardel and the hooks and leaders. That can be replaced. But who replaces this fish if I
hook some fish and it cuts him off?
I don’t know what that fish was that took the bait just now. It could have been a
marlin or a broadbill or a shark. I never felt him. I had to get rid of him too fast.
Aloud he said, “I wish I had the boy.”

[51] But you haven’t got the boy, he thought. You have only yourself and you had
better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and
hook up the two reserve coils.
So he did it. It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled
him down on his face and made a cut below his eye. The blood ran down his cheek a little
way. But it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to
the bow and rested against the wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line
so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his
shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of
the skiff through the water.
I wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought. The wire must have slipped on the
great hill of his back. Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does. But he cannot
pull this skiff forever, no matter how great he is. Now everything is cleared away that
might make trouble and I have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.
“Fish,” he said softly, aloud, “I’ll stay with you until I am dead.”
[52] He’ll stay with me too, I suppose, the old man thought and he waited for it to be
light. It was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be
warm. I can do it as long as he can, he thought. And in the first light the line extended out
and down into the water. The boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose
it was on the old man’s right shoulder.
“He’s headed north,” the old man said. The current will have set us far to the
eastward, he thought. I wish he would turn with the current. That would show that he
was tiring.
When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring.
There was only one favorable sign. The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a
lesser depth. That did not necessarily mean that he would jump. But he might.
“God let him jump,” the old man said. “I have enough line to handle him.”
Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he
thought. Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he’ll fill the sacks along his backbone
with air and then he cannot go deep to die.
[53] He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of
the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned
back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it. I must not jerk it ever, he
thought. Each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might
throw it. Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to look into it.
There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added
drag and he was pleased. It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much
phosphorescence in the night.
“Fish,” he said, “I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before
this day ends.”

Let us hope so, he thought.
A small bird came toward the skiff from the north. He was a warbler and flying very
low over
the water. The old man could see that he was very tired. The bird made the stern of
the boat and rested there. Then he flew around the old man’s head and rested on the line
where he was more comfortable. “How old are you?” the old man asked the bird. “Is this
your first trip?”
[54] The bird looked at him when he spoke. He was too tired even to examine the
line and he teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast.
“It’s steady,” the old man told him. “It’s too steady. You shouldn’t be that tired after
a windless night. What are birds coming to?”
The hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them. But he said nothing of
this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the
hawks soon enough.
“Take a good rest, small bird,” he said. “Then go in and take your chance like any
man or bird or fish.”
It encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly
now.
“Stay at my house if you like, bird,” he said. “I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and
take you in with the small breeze that is rising. But I am with a friend.”
Just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow
and would have pulled him overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line.
The bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him
go. He felt the line [55] carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding.
“Something hurt him then,” he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he
could turn the fish. But when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and
settled back against the strain of the line.
“You’re feeling it now, fish,” he said. “And so, God knows, am I.”
He looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company.
The bird was gone.
You did not stay long, the man thought. But it is rougher where you are going until
you make the shore. How did I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made? I
must be getting very stupid. Or perhaps I was looking at the small bird and thinking of
him. Now I will pay attention to my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I will not
have a failure of strength.
“I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt,” he said aloud.

 The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
Shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed
his hand in the ocean and held it there, submerged, for more than a [56] minute watching
the blood trail away and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat
moved.
“He has slowed much,” he said.
The old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was
afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held
his hand up against the sun. It was only a line burn that had cut his flesh. But it was in
the working part of his hand. He knew he would need his hands before this was over and
he did not like to be cut before it started.
“Now,” he said, when his hand had dried, “I must eat the small tuna. I can reach him
with the gaff and eat him here in comfort.”
He knelt down and found the tuna under the stem with the gaff and drew it toward
him keeping it clear of the coiled lines. Holding the line with his left shoulder again, and
bracing on his left hand and arm, he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back
in place. He put one knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from
the back of the head to the tail. They were wedge-shaped strips and he cut [57] them from
next to the back bone down to the edge of the belly. When he had cut six strips he spread
them out on the wood of the bow, wiped his knife on his trousers, and lifted the carcass of
the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard.
“I don’t think I can eat an entire one,” he said and drew his knife across one of the
strips. He could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped. It
drew up tight on the heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust.
“What kind of a hand is that,” he said. “Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a
claw. It will do you no good.”
Come on, he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line.
Eat it now and it will strengthen the hand. It is not the hand’s fault and you have been
many hours with the fish. But you can stay with him forever. Eat the bonito now.
He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly. It was not
unpleasant.
Chew it well, he thought, and get all the juices. It would not be had to eat with a little
lime or with lemon or with salt.
“How do you feel, hand?” he asked the cramped [58] hand that was almost as stiff as
rigor mortis. “I’ll eat some more for you.”
He ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two. He chewed it carefully and
then spat out the skin.
“How does it go, hand? Or is it too early to know?”
He took another full piece and chewed it.

“It is a strong full-blooded fish,” he thought. “I was lucky to get him instead of
dolphin. Dolphin is too sweet. This is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it.”
There is no sense in being anything but practical though, he thought. I wish I had
some salt. And I do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left, so I had better
eat it all although I am not hungry. The fish is calm and steady. I will eat it all and then I
will be ready.
“Be patient, hand,” he said. “I do this for you.”
I wish I could feed the fish, he thought. He is my brother. But I must kill him and
keep strong to do it. Slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedge-shaped strips of
fish.
He straightened up, wiping his hand on his trousers. “Now,” he said. “You can let the
cord go, hand, and I will handle him with the right arm alone until you [59] stop that
nonsense.” He put his left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back
against the pull against his back.
“God help me to have the cramp go,” he said. “Because I do not know what the fish is
going to do.”
But he seems calm, he thought, and following his plan. But what is his plan, he
thought. And what is mine? Mine I must improvise to his because of his great size. If he
will jump I can kill him. But he stays down forever. Then I will stay down with him
forever.
He rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers. But
it would not open. Maybe it will open with the sun, he thought. Maybe it will open when
the strong raw tuna is digested. If I have to have it, I will open it, cost whatever it costs.
But I do not want to open it now by force. Let it open by itself and come back of its own
accord. After all I abused it much in the night when it was necessary to free and untie the
various lines.
He looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now. But he could see the
prisms in the deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and the strange undulation
of the calm. The clouds were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and
saw a [60] flight of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water, then
blurring, then etching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea.
He thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boar and
knew they were right in the months of sudden bad weather. But now they were in
hurricane months and, when there are no hurricanes, the weather of hurricane months is
the best of all the year.
If there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead, if you
are at sea. They do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for, he
thought. The land must make a difference too, in the shape of the clouds. But we have no
hurricane coming now.
He looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly piles of ice cream

and high above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high September sky.
“Light brisa,” he said. “Better weather for me than for you, fish.”
His left hand was still cramped, but he was unknotting it slowly.
I hate a cramp, he thought. It is a treachery of one’s [61] own body. It is humiliating
before others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it. But a
cramp, he thought of it as a calambre, humiliates oneself especially when one is alone.
If the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm, he
thought. But it will loosen up.
Then, with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw
the slant change in the water. Then, as he leaned against the line and slapped his left
hand hard and fast against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.
“He’s coming up,” he said. “Come on hand. Please come on.”
The line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of
the boat and the fish came out. He came out unendingly and water poured from his sides.
He was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the
stripes on his sides showed wide and a light lavender. His sword was as long as a baseball
bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the water and then
re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the old [62] man saw the great scythe-blade of
his tail go under and the line commenced to race out.
“He is two feet longer than the skiff,” the old man said. The line was going out fast
but steadily and the fish was not panicked. The old man was trying with both hands to
keep the line just inside of breaking strength. He knew that if he could not slow the fish
with a steady pressure the fish could take out all the line and break it.
He is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought. I must never let him learn his
strength nor what he could do if he made his run. If I were him I would put in everything
now and go until something broke. But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who
kill them; although they are more noble and more able.
The old man had seen many great fish. He had seen many that weighed more than a
thousand pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life, but never alone. Now
alone, and out of sight of land, he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and
bigger than he had ever heard of, and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws
of an eagle.
[63] It will uncramp though, he thought. Surely it will uncramp to help my right
hand. There are three things that are brothers: the fish and my two hands. It must
uncramp. It is unworthy of it to be cramped. The fish had slowed again and was going at
his usual pace.
I wonder why he jumped, the old man thought. He jumped almost as though to show
me how big he was. I know now, anyway, he thought. I wish I could show him what sort
of man I am. But then he would see the cramped hand. Let him think I am more man

than I am and I will be so. I wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has
against only my will and my intelligence.
He settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the
fish swam steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water. There was a small
sea rising with the wind coming up from the east and at noon the old man’s left hand was
uncramped.
“Bad news for you, fish,” he said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his
shoulders.
He was comfortable but suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all.
“I am not religious,” he said. “But I will say ten Our [64] Fathers and ten Hail Marys
that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Cobre if I
catch him. That is a promise.”
He commenced to say his prayers mechanically. Sometimes he would be so tired that
he could not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would
come automatically. Hail Marys are easier to say than Our Fathers, he thought.
“Hail Mary full of Grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.” Then he added, “Blessed Virgin, pray for the
death of this fish. Wonderful though he is.”
With his prayers said, and feeling much better, but suffering exactly as much, and
perhaps a little more, he leaned against the wood of the bow and began, mechanically, to
work the fingers of his left hand.
The sun was hot now although the breeze was rising gently.
“I had better re-bait that little line out over the stern,” he said. “If the fish decides to
stay another night I will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottle. I don’t think
I can get anything but a dolphin [65] here. But if I eat him fresh enough he won’t be bad.
I wish a flying fish would come on board tonight. But I have no light to attract them. A
flying fish is excellent to eat raw and I would not have to cut him up. I must save all my
strength now. Christ, I did not know he was so big.”
“I’ll kill him though,” he said. “In all his greatness and his glory.”
Although it is unjust, he thought. But I will show him what a man can do and what a
man endures.
“I told the boy I was a strange old man,” he said.
“Now is when I must prove it.”
The thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing. Now he was proving it
again. Each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing
it.

I wish he’d sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought. Why are
the lions the main thing that is left? Don’t think, old man, he said to himself, Rest gently
now against the wood and think of nothing. He is working. Work as little as you can.
It was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily. But
there was an added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man [66] rode gently
with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and
smoothly.
Once in the afternoon the line started to rise again. But the fish only continued to
swim at a slightly higher level. The sun was on the old man’s left arm and shoulder and
on his back. So he knew the fish had turned east of north.
Now that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming in the water
with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the
dark. I wonder how much he sees at that depth, the old man thought. His eye is huge and
a horse, with much less eye, can see in the dark. Once I could see quite well in the dark.
Not in the absolute dark. But almost as a cat sees.
The sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now
completely and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of
his back to shift the hurt of the cord a little.
“If you’re not tired, fish,” he said aloud, “you must be very strange.”
He felt very tired now and he knew the night would come soon and he tried to think
of other things. He thought of the Big Leagues, to him they were the Gran [67] Ligas, and
he knew that the Yankees of New York were playing the Tigres of Detroit.
This is the second day now that I do not know the result of the juegos, he thought.
But I must have confidence and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all
things perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel. What is a bone spur? he
asked himself. Un espuela de hueso. We do not have them. Can it be as painful as the
spur of a fighting cock in one’s heel? I do not think I could endure that or the loss of the
eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks do. Man is not much
beside the great birds and beasts. Still I would rather be that beast down there in the
darkness of the sea.
“Unless sharks come,” he said aloud. “If sharks come, God pity him and me.”
Do you believe the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I will stay with
this one? he thought. I am sure he would and more since he is young and strong. Also his
father was a fisherman. But would the bone spur hurt him too much?
“I do not know,” he said aloud. “I never had a bone spur.”
As the sun set he remembered, to give himself more [68] confidence, the time in the
tavern at Casablanca when he had played the hand game with the great negro from
Cienfuegos who was the strongest man on the docks. They had gone one day and one
night with their elbows on a chalk line on the table and their forearms straight up and
their hands gripped tight. Each one was trying to force the other’s hand down onto the

table. There was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the
kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negro’s
face. They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees
could sleep. Blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negro’s hands
and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors
went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched. The
walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows
against them. The negro’s shadow was huge and it moved on the wall as the breeze
moved the lamps.
The odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and
lighted cigarettes for him.
Then the negro, after the rum, would try for a tremendous [69] effort and once he
had the old man, who was not an old man then but was Santiago El Campeon, nearly
three inches off balance. But the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again. He
was sure then that he had the negro, who was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten. And
at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be called a draw and the referee was
shaking his head, he had unleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and
down until it rested on the wood. The match had started on a Sunday morning and ended
on a Monday morning. Many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they had to go
to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the Havana Coal Company. Otherwise
everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish. But he had finished it anyway and before
anyone had to go to work.
For a long time after that everyone had called him The Champion and there had
been a return match in the spring. But not much money was bet and he had won it quite
easily since he had broken the confidence of the negro from Cienfuegos in the first match.
After that he had a few matches and then no more. He decided that he could beat anyone
if he wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was bad for his right [70] hand for
fishing. He had tried a few practice matches with his left hand. But his left hand had
always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it to do and he did not trust it.
The sun will bake it out well now, he thought. It should not cramp on me again
unless it gets too cold in the night. I wonder what this night will bring.
An airplane passed overhead on its course to Miami and he watched its shadow
scaring up the schools of flying fish.
“With so much flying fish there should be dolphin,” he said, and leaned back on the
line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish. But he could not and it stayed at the
hardness and water-drop shivering that preceded breaking. The boat moved ahead slowly
and he watched the airplane until he could no longer see it.
It must be very strange in an airplane, he thought. I wonder what the sea looks like
from that height? They should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high. I
would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above. In
the turtle boats I was in the cross-trees of the mast-head and even at that height I saw
much. The dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripes and their purple

[71] spots and you can see all of the school as they swim. Why is it that all the fast-moving
fish of the dark current have purple backs and usually purple stripes or spots? The
dolphin looks green of course because he is really golden. But when he comes to feed,
truly hungry, purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin. Can it be anger, or the
greater speed he makes that brings them out?
Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved
and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a
yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in
the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. It
jumped again and again in the acrobatics of its fear and he worked his way back to the
stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and arm, he pulled the
dolphin in with his left hand, stepping on the gained line each time with his bare left foot.
When the fish was at the stem, plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation, the
old man leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish with its purple spots over
the stem. Its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites against [72] the hook and it
pounded the bottom of the skiff with its long flat body, its tail and its head until he
clubbed it across the shining golden head until it shivered and was still.
The old man unhooked the fish, re-baited the line with another sardine and tossed it
over. Then he worked his way slowly back to the bow. He washed his left hand and wiped
it on his trousers. Then he shifted the heavy line from his right hand to his left and
washed his right hand in the sea while he watched the sun go into the ocean and the slant
of the big cord.
“He hasn’t changed at all,” he said. But watching the movement of the water against
his hand he noted that it was perceptibly slower.
“I’ll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night,”
he said. “He’s good for the night and so am I.”
It would be better to gut the dolphin a little later to save the blood in the meat, he
thought. I can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time. I
had better keep the fish quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset. The setting of
the sun is a difficult time for all fish. He let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line
[73] with it and eased himself as much as he could and allowed himself to be pulled
forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as much, or more, than he did.
I’m learning how to do it, he thought. This part of it anyway. Then too, remember he
hasn’t eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food. I have eaten the
whole bonito. Tomorrow I will eat the dolphin. He called it dorado. Perhaps I should eat
some of it when I clean it. It will be harder to eat than the bonito. But, then, nothing is
easy.
“How do you feel, fish?” he asked aloud. “I feel good and my left hand is better and I
have food for a night and a day. Pull the boat, fish.”
He did not truly feel good because the pain from the cord across his back had almost
passed pain and gone into a dullness that he mistrusted. But I have had worse things
than that, he thought. My hand is only cut a little and the cramp is gone from the other.

My legs are all right. Also now I have gained on him in the question of sustenance.
It was dark now as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in September. He lay
against the worn wood of the bow and rested all that he could. The first stars [74] were
out. He did not know the name of Rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out
and he would have all his distant friends.
“The fish is my friend too,” he said aloud. “I have never seen or heard of such a fish.
But I must kill him. I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars.”
Imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought. The moon runs
away. But imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun? We were born
lucky, he thought.
Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to
kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. How many people will he feed, he thought.
But are they worthy to eat him? No, of course not. There is no one worthy of eating him
from the manner of his behaviour and his great dignity.
I do not understand these things, he thought. But it is good that we do not have to
try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars. It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true
brothers.
Now, he thought, I must think about the drag. It has its perils and its merits. I may
lose so much line that I will lose him, if he makes his effort and the drag [75] made by the
oars is in place and the boat loses all her lightness. Her lightness prolongs both our
suffering but it is my safety since he has great speed that he has never yet employed. No
matter what passes I must gut the dolphin so he does not spoil and eat some of him to be
strong.
Now I will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady before I move back
to the stern to do the work and make the decision. In the meantime I can see how he acts
and if he shows any changes. The oars are a good trick; but it has reached the time to play
for safety. He is much fish still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth
and he has kept his mouth tight shut. The punishment of the hook is nothing. The
punishment of hunger, and that he is against something that he does not comprehend, is
everything. Rest now, old man, and let him work until your next duty comes.
He rested for what he believed to be two hours. The moon did not rise now until late
and he had no way of judging the time. Nor was he really resting except comparatively.
He was still bearing the pull of the fish across his shoulders but he placed his left hand on
the [76] gunwale of the bow and confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to
the skiff itself.
How simple it would be if I could make the line fast, he thought. But with one small
lurch he could break it. I must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all times
be ready to give line with both hands.
“But you have not slept yet, old man,” he said aloud. “It is half a day and a night and
now another day and you have not slept. You must devise a way so that you sleep a little if

he is quiet and steady. If you do not sleep you might become unclear in the head.”
I’m clear enough in the head, he thought. Too clear. I am as clear as the stars that are
my brothers. Still I must sleep. They sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the
ocean sleeps sometimes on certain days when there is no current and a flat calm.
But remember to sleep, he thought. Make yourself do it and devise some simple and
sure way about the lines. Now go back and prepare the dolphin. It is too dangerous to rig
the oars as a drag if you must sleep.
I could go without sleeping, he told himself. But it would be too dangerous.
[77] He started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees, being
careful not to jerk against the fish. He may be half asleep himself, he thought. But I do
not want him to rest. He must pull until he dies.
Back in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of the line across his
shoulders and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand. The stars were bright
now and he saw the dolphin clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head
and drew him out from under the stern. He put one of his feet on the fish and slit him
quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower jaw. Then he put his knife down and
gutted him with his right hand, scooping him clean and pulling the gills clear.
He felt the maw heavy and slippery in his hands and he slit it open. There were two
flying fish inside. They were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped
the guts and the gills over the stern. They sank leaving a trail of phosphorescence in the
water. The dolphin was cold and a leprous gray-white now in the starlight and the old
man skinned one side of him while he held his right foot on the fish’s head. Then he
turned him over and skinned the other side and cut each side off from the head down to
the tail.
[78] He slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the
water. But there was only the light of its slow descent. He turned then and placed the two
flying fish inside the two fillets of fish and putting his knife back in its sheath, he worked
his way slowly back to the bow. His back was bent with the weight of the line across it and
he carried the fish in his right hand.
Back in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish
beside them. After that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it
again with his left hand resting on the gunwale. Then he leaned over the side and washed
the flying fish in the water, noting the speed of the water against his hand. His hand was
phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he watched the flow of the water against it.
The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking of the
skiff, particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern.
“He is tiring or he is resting,” the old man said. “Now let me get through the eating of
this dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep.”
Under the stars and with the night colder all the [79] time he ate half of one of the
dolphin fillets and one of the flying fish, gutted and with its head cut off.

“What an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked,” he said. “And what a miserable fish
raw. I will never go in a boat again without salt or limes.”
If I had brains I would have splashed water on the bow all day and drying, it would
have made salt, he thought. But then I did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset. Still
it was a lack of preparation. But I have chewed it all well and I am not nauseated.
The sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were
gone. It looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and the wind
had dropped.
“There will be bad weather in three or four days,” he said. “But not tonight and not
tomorrow. Rig now to get some sleep, old man, while the fish is calm and steady.”
He held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh against his right
hand as he leaned all his weight against the wood of the bow. Then he passed the line a
little lower on his shoulders and braced his left hand on it.
My right hand can hold it as long as it is braced, he [80] thought If it relaxes in sleep
my left hand will wake me as the line goes out. It is hard on the right hand. But he is used
to punishment Even if I sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good. He lay forward
cramping himself against the line with all of his body, putting all his weight onto his right
band, and he was asleep.
He did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises that stretched
for eight or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating and they would leap high into
the air and return into the same hole they had made in the water when they leaped.
Then he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther and
he was very cold and his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of
a pillow.
After that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the
lions come down onto it in the early dark and then the other lions came and he rested his
chin on the wood of the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore
breeze and he waited to see if there would be more lions and he was happy.
The moon had been up for a long time but he slept [81] on and the fish pulled on
steadily and the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds.
He woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning
out through his right hand. He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could
with his right and the line rushed out. Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned
back against the line and now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left hand was
taking all the strain and cutting badly. He looked back at the coils of line and they were
feeding smoothly. Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean and
then a heavy fall. Then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although
line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to breaking point and
raising it to breaking point again and again. He had been pulled down tight onto the bow
and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move.

This is what we waited for, he thought. So now let us take it. Make him pay for the
line, he thought. Make him pay for it.
He could not see the fish’s jumps but only heard the [82] breaking of the ocean and
the heavy splash as he fell. The speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had
always known this would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused
parts and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the fingers.
If the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought. Yes. If the boy were
here. If the boy were here.
The line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish
earn each inch of it. Now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish
that his cheek had crushed. Then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet.
He was ceding line but more slowly all he time. He worked back to where he could feel
with his foot the coils of line that he could not see. There was plenty of line still and now
the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water.
Yes, he thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the
sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring
him up. He will start circling soon and then I must work on him. I wonder what started
him so suddenly? Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, [83] or was he
frightened by something in the night? Maybe he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a
calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident. It is strange.
“You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,” he said. “You’re holding
him again but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle.”
The old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and stooped down
and scooped up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face. He
was afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength. When
his face was cleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side and then let it
stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise. He’s
headed almost east, he thought. That means he is tired and going with the current. Soon
he will have to circle. Then our true work begins.
After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out
and looked at it.
“It is not bad,” he said. “And pain does not matter to a man.”
He took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts
and shifted his weight [84] so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other
side of the skiff.
“You did not do so badly for something worthless,” he said to his left hand. “But
there was a moment when I could not find you.”
Why was I not born with two good hands? he thought. Perhaps it was my fault in not
training that one properly. But God knows he has had enough chances to learn. He did
not do so badly in the night, though, and he has only cramped once. If he cramps again

let the line cut him off.
When he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and he thought he
should chew some more of the dolphin. But I can’t, he told himself. It is better to be
light-headed than to lose your strength from nausea. And I know I cannot keep it if I eat
it since my face was in it. I will keep it for an emergency until it goes bad. But it is too late
to try for strength now through nourishment. You’re stupid, he told himself. Eat the other
flying fish.
It was there, cleaned and ready, and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it
chewing the bones carefully and eating all of it down to the tail.
It has more nourishment than almost any fish, he [85] thought. At least the kind of
strength that I need. Now I have done what I can, he thought. Let him begin to circle and
let the fight come.
The sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to
circle.
He could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling. It was too early for
that. He just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull
on it gently with his right hand. It tightened, as always, but just when he reached the
point where it would break, line began to come in. He slipped his shoulders and head
from under the line and began to pull in line steadily and gently. He used both of his
hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as much as he could with his body
and his legs. His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of the pulling.
“It is a very big circle,” he said. “But he is circling.” Then the line would not come in
any more and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun. Then it started
out and the old man knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water.
“He is making the far part of his circle now,” he said. I must hold all I can, he
thought. The strain will [86] shorten his circle each time. Perhaps in an hour I will see
him. Now I must convince him and then I must kill him.
But the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired
deep into his bones two hours later. But the circles were much shorter now and from the
way the line slanted he could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam.
For an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat
salted his eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead. He was not afraid of
the black spots. They were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line. Twice,
though, he had felt faint and dizzy and that had worried him.
“I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this,” he said. “Now that I have him
coming so beautifully, God help me endure. I’ll say a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred
Hail Marys. But I cannot say them now.
Consider them said, he thought. I’ll say them later. Just then he felt a sudden
banging and jerking on the line he held with his two hands. It was sharp and hard-feeling
and heavy.

He is hitting the wire leader with his spear, he [87] thought. That was bound to come.
He had to do that. It may make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling
now. The jumps were necessary for him to take air. But after that each one can widen the
opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook.
“Don’t jump, fish,” he said. “Don’t jump.”
The fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the old
man gave up a little line.
I must hold his pain where it is, he thought. Mine does not matter. I can control
mine. But his pain could drive him mad.
After a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again.
The old man was gaining line steadily now. But he felt faint again. He lifted some sea
water with his left hand and put it on his head. Then he put more on and rubbed the back
of his neck.
“I have no cramps,” he said. “He’ll be up soon and I can last. You have to last. Don’t
even speak of it.”
He kneeled against the bow and, for a moment, slipped the line over his back again.
I’ll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he
comes in, he decided.
[88] It was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by
himself without recovering any line. But when the strain showed the fish had turned to
come toward the boat, the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the
weaving pulling that brought in all the line he gained.
I’m tireder than I have ever been, he thought, and now the trade wind is rising. But
that will be good to take him in with. I need that badly.
“I’ll rest on the next turn as he goes out,” he said. “I feel much better. Then in two or
three turns more I will have him.”
His straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the bow with the
pull of the line as he felt the fish turn.
You work now, fish, he thought. I’ll take you at the turn.
The sea had risen considerably. But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it
to get home.
“I’ll just steer south and west,” he said. “A man is never lost at sea and it is a long
island.”
It was on the third turn that he saw the fish first.
He saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long [89] to pass under the boat that
he could not believe its length.

“No,” he said. “He can’t be that big.”
But he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty
yards away and the man saw his tail out of water. It was higher than a big scythe blade
and a very pale lavender above the dark blue water. It raked back and as the fish swam
just below the surface the old man could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that
banded him. His dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals were spread wide.
On this circle the old man could see the fish’s eye and the two gray sucking fish that
swain around him. Sometimes they attached themselves to him. Sometimes they darted
off. Sometimes they would swim easily in his shadow. They were each over three feet long
and when they swam fast they lashed their whole bodies like eels.
The old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun. On each
calm placid turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in two turns
more he would have a chance to get the harpoon in.
[90] But I must get him close, close, close, he thought. I mustn’t try for the head. I
must get the heart.
“Be calm and strong, old man,” he said.
On the next circle the fish’s beck was out but he was a little too far from the boat. On
the next circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the old man
was sure that by gaining some more line he could have him alongside.
He had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in a round basket
and the end was made fast to the bitt in the bow.
The fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his
great tail moving. The old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer. For
just a moment the fish turned a little on his side. Then he straightened himself and began
another circle.
“I moved him,” the old man said. “I moved him then.”
He felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could. I
moved him, he thought. Maybe this time I can get him over. Pull, hands, he thought.
Hold up, legs. Last for me, head. Last for me. You never went. This time I’ll pull him over.
[91] But when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the fish came
alongside and pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled part way over and then righted
himself and swam away.
“Fish,” the old man said. “Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to
kill me too?”
That way nothing is accomplished, he thought. His mouth was too dry to speak but
he could not reach for the water now. I must get him alongside this time, he thought. I
am not good for many more turns. Yes you are, he told himself. You’re good for ever.

On the next turn, he nearly had him. But again the fish righted himself and swam
slowly away.
You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I
seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother.
Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who.
Now you are getting confused in the head, he thought. You must keep your head
clear. Keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man. Or a fish, he thought.
“Clear up, head,” he said in a voice he could hardly hear. “Clear up.”
[92] Twice more it was the same on the turns. I do not know, the old man thought.
He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time. I do not know. But I will try it
once more. He tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish. The
fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air. I’ll
try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could
only see well in flashes. He tried it again and it was the same. So he thought, and he felt
himself going before he started; I will try it once again.
He took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he
put it against the fish’s agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his
side, his bill almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat, long,
deep, wide, silver and barred with purple and interminable in the water.
The old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as
he could and drove it down with all his strength, and more strength he had [93] just
summoned, into the fish’s side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to
the altitude of the man’s chest. He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it
further and then pushed all his weight after it.
Then the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water
showing all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty. He seemed to
hang in the air above the old man in the skiff. Then he fell into the water with a crash that
sent spray over the old man and over all of the skiff.
The old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well. But he cleared the harpoon
line and let it run slowly through his raw hands and, when he could see, he saw the fish
was on his back with his silver belly up. The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an
angle from the fish’s shoulder and the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from
his heart. First it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that was more than a mile deep.
Then it spread like a cloud. The fish was silvery and still and floated with the waves.
The old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had. Then he took two
turns of the harpoon [94] line around the bitt in the bow and hid his head on his hands.
“Keep my head dear,” he said against the wood of the bow. “I am a tired old man. But
I have killed this fish which is my brother and now I must do the slave work.”
Now I must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside, he thought. Even
if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out, this skiff would never

hold him. I must prepare everything, then bring him in and lash him well and step the
mast and set sail for home.
He started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line
through his gills and out his mouth and make his head fast alongside the bow. I want to
see him, he thought, and to touch and to feel him. He is my fortune, he thought. But that
is not why I wish to feel him. I think I felt his heart, he thought. When I pushed on the
harpoon shaft the second time. Bring him in now and make him fast and get the noose
around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to the skiff.
“Get to work, old man,” he said. He took a very [95] small drink of the water. “There
is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is over.”
He looked up at the sky and then out to his fish. He looked at the sun carefully. It is
not much more than noon, he thought. And the trade wind is rising. The lines all mean
nothing now. The boy and I will splice them when we are home.
“Come on, fish,” he said. But the fish did not come.
Instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff upon
to him.
When he was even with him and had the fish’s head against the bow he could not
believe his size. But he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt, passed it through the fish’s
gills and out his jaws, made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the
other gill, made another turn around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it
fast to the bitt in the bow. He cut the rope then and went astern to noose the tail. The fish
had turned silver from his original purple and silver, and the stripes showed the same
pale violet colour as his tail. They were wider than a man’s hand with his fingers spread
and the fish’s eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a saint in a
procession.
[96] “It was the only way to kill him,” the old man said. He was feeling better since
the water and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear. He’s over fifteen
hundred pounds the way he is, he thought. Maybe much more. If he dresses out
two-thirds of that at thirty cents a pound?
“I need a pencil for that,” he said. “My head is not that clear. But I think the great
DiMaggio would be proud of me today. I had no bone spurs. But the hands and the back
hurt truly.” I wonder what a bone spur is, he thought. Maybe we have them without
knowing of it.
He made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart. He was so big it
was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside. He cut a piece of line and tied the fish’s
lower jaw against his bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as
possible. Then he stepped the mast and, with the stick that was his gaff and with his
boom rigged, the patched sail drew, the boat began to move, and half lying in the stern he
sailed south-west.
He did not need a compass to tell him where southwest was. He only needed the feel

of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail. I better put a small line [97] out with a
spoon on it and try and get something to eat and drink for the moisture. But he could not
find a spoon and his sardines were rotten. So he hooked a patch of yellow Gulf weed with
the gaff as they passed and shook it so that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the
planking of the skiff. There were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked
like sand fleas. The old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and forefinger and
ate them chewing up the shells and the tails. They were very tiny but he knew they were
nourishing and they tasted good.
The old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after
he had eaten the shrimps. The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he
steered with the tiller under his arm. He could see the fish and he had only to look at his
hands and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was
not a dream. At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, he had thought
perhaps it was a dream. Then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and hang
motionless in the sky before he fell, he was sure there was some great strangeness and he
could not believe it.
[98] Then he could not see well, although now he saw as well as ever. Now he knew
there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream. The hands cure quickly, he
thought. I bled them clean and the salt water will heal them. The dark water of the true
gulf is the greatest healer that there is. All I must do is keep the head clear. The hands
have done their work and we sail well. With his mouth shut and his tail straight up and
down we sail like brothers. Then his head started to become a little unclear and he
thought, is he bringing me in or am I bringing him in? If I were towing him behind there
would be no question. Nor if the fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone, there would
be no question either. But they were sailing together lashed side by side and the old man
thought, let him bring me in if it pleases him. I am only better than him through trickery
and he meant me no harm.
They sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep
his head clear. There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the
old man knew the breeze would last all night. The old man looked at the fish constantly
[99] to make sure it was true. It was an hour before the first shark hit him.
The shark was not an accident. He had come up from deep down in the water as the
dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea. He had come up so
fast and absolutely without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in
the sun. Then he fell back into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on
the course the skiff and the fish had taken.
Sometimes he lost the scent. But he would pick it up again, or have just a trace of it,
and he swam fast and hard on the course. He was a very big Make shark built to swim as
fast as the fastest fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws.
His back was as blue as a sword fish’s and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth
and handsome. He was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight
shut now as he swam fast, just under the surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through
the water without wavering. Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of
teeth were slanted inwards. They were not the ordinary pyramid-shaped teeth of most

sharks. They were shaped like a man’s [100] fingers when they are crisped like claws.
They were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man and they had razor-sharp cutting
edges on both sides. This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea, that were so
fast and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy. Now he speeded up as he
smelled the fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water.
When the old man saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had no fear at
all and would do exactly what he wished. He prepared the harpoon and made the rope
fast while he watched the shark come on. The rope was short as it lacked what he had cut
away to lash the fish.
The old man’s head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had
little hope. It was too good to last, he thought. He took one look at the great fish as he
watched the shark close in. It might as well have been a dream, he thought. I cannot keep
him from hitting me but maybe I can get him. Dentuso, he thought. Bad luck to your
mother.
The shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth
open and his strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the
meat just above the tail. The shark’s head [101] was out of water and his back was coming
out and the old man could hear the noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he
rammed the harpoon down onto the shark’s head at a spot where the line between his
eyes intersected with the line that ran straight back from his nose. There were no such
lines. There was only the heavy sharp blue head and the big eyes and the clicking,
thrusting all-swallowing jaws. But that was the location of the brain and the old man hit
it. He hit it with his blood mushed hands driving a good harpoon with all his strength. He
hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy.
The shark swung over and the old man saw his eye was not alive and then he swung
over once again, wrapping himself in two loops of the rope. The old man knew that he
was dead but the shark would not accept it. Then, on his back, with his tail lashing and
his jaws clicking, the shark plowed over the water as a speedboat does. The water was
white where his tail beat it and three-quarters of his body was clear above the water when
the rope came taut, shivered, and then snapped. The shark lay quietly for a little while on
the surface and the old man watched him. Then he went down very slowly.
[102] “He took about forty pounds,” the old man said aloud. He took my harpoon too
and all the rope, he thought, and now my fish bleeds again and there will be others. He
did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been mutilated. When the fish had
been hit it was as though he himself were hit. But I killed the shark that hit my fish, he
thought. And he was the biggest dentuso that I have ever seen. And God knows that I
have seen big ones. It was too good to last, he thought. I wish it had been a dream now
and that I had never hooked the fish and was alone in bed on the newspapers.
“But man is not made for defeat,” he said. “A man can be destroyed but not
defeated.” I am sorry that I killed the fish though, he thought. Now the bad time is
coming and I do not even have the harpoon. The dentuso is cruel and able and strong and
intelligent. But I was more intelligent than he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I
was only better armed.

“Don’t think, old man,” he said aloud. “Sail on this course and take it when it comes.
But I must think, he thought. Because it is all I have left. That and baseball. I wonder
how the great [103] DiMaggio would have liked the way I hit him in the brain? It was no
great thing, he thought. Any man could do it. But do you think my hands were as great a
handicap as the bone spurs? I cannot know. I never had anything wrong with my heel
except the time the sting ray stung it when I stepped on him when swimming and
paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain.
“Think about something cheerful, old man,” he said. “Every minute now you are
closer to home. You sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds.”
He knew quite well the pattern of what could happen when he reached the inner part
of the current. But there was nothing to be done now.
“Yes there is,” he said aloud. “I can lash my knife to the butt of one of the oars.”
So he did that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the sail under his foot.
“Now,” he said. “I am still an old man. But I am not unarmed.”
The breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well. He watched only the forward part of
the fish and some of his hope returned.
It is silly not to hope, he thought. Besides I believe [104] it is a sin. Do not think
about sin, he thought. There are enough problems now without sin. Also I have no
understanding of it.
I have no understanding of it and I am not sure that I believe in it. Perhaps it was a
sin to kill the fish. I suppose it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many
people. But then everything is a sin. Do not think about sin. It is much too late for that
and there are people who are paid to do it. Let them think about it. You were born to be a
fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish. San Pedro was a fisherman as was the father
of the great DiMaggio.
But he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and since there was
nothing to read and he did not have a radio, he thought much and he kept on thinking
about sin. You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he thought. You
killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive
and you loved him after. If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?
“You think too much, old man,” he said aloud.
But you enjoyed killing the dentuso, he thought. He lives on the live fish as you do.
He is not a scavenger [105] nor just a moving appetite as some sharks are. He is beautiful
and noble and knows no fear of anything.
“I killed him in self-defense,” the old man said aloud. “And I killed him well.”
Besides, he thought, everything kills everything else in some way. Fishing kills me
exactly as it keeps me alive. The boy keeps me alive, he thought. I must not deceive

myself too much.
He leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the
shark had cut him. He chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste. It was firm and
juicy, like meat, but it was not red. There was no stringiness in it and he knew that it
would bring the highest price In the market. But there was no way to keep its scent out of
the water and the old man knew that a very had time was coming.
The breeze was steady. It had backed a little further into the north-east and he knew
that meant that it would not fall off. The old man looked ahead of him but he could see no
sails nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of any ship. There were only the flying fish
that went up from his bow sailing away to either side and the yellow patches of Gulf weed.
He could not even see a bird.
[106] He had sailed for two hours, resting in the stern and sometimes chewing a bit
of the meat from the marlin, trying to rest and to be strong, when he saw the first of the
two sharks. “Ay,” he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is
just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his
hands and into the wood.
“Galanos,” he said aloud. He had seen the second fin now coming up behind the first
and had identified them as shovel-nosed sharks by the brown, triangular fin and the
sweeping movements of the tail. They had the scent and were excited and in the stupidity
of their great hunger they were losing and finding the scent in their excitement. But they
were closing all the time.
The old man made the sheet fast and jammed the tiller. Then he took up the oar with
the knife lashed to it. He lifted it as lightly as he could because his hands rebelled at the
pain. Then he opened and closed them on it lightly to loosen them. He closed them firmly
so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watched the sharks come. He
could see their wide, flattened, shovel-pointed heads now and their white tipped wide
pectoral fins. They were hateful sharks, [107] bad smelling, scavengers as well as killers,
and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat. It was these
sharks that would cut the turtles’ legs and flippers off when the turtles were asleep on the
surface, and they would hit a man in the water, if they were hungry, even if the man had
no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him.
“Ay,” the old man said. “Galanos. Come on galanos.”
They came. But they did not come as the Mako had come. One turned and went out
of sight under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff shake as he jerked and pulled
on the fish. The other watched the old man with his slitted yellow eyes and then came in
fast with his half circle of jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten. The
line showed clearly on the top of his brown head and back where the brain joined the
spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the oar into the juncture, withdrew it, and
drove it in again into the shark’s yellow cat-like eyes. The shark let go of the fish and slid
down, swallowing what he had taken as he died.
The skiff was still shaking with the destruction the other shark was doing to the fish
and the old man let [108] go the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadside and bring

the shark out from under. When he saw the shark he leaned over the side and punched at
him. He hit only meat and the hide was set hard and he barely got the knife in. The blow
hurt not only his hands but his shoulder too. But the shark came up fast with his head out
and the old man hit him squarely in the center of his flat-topped head as his nose came
out of water and lay against the fish. The old man withdrew the blade and punched the
shark exactly in the same spot again. He still hung to the fish with his jaws hooked and
the old man stabbed him in his left eye. The shark still hung there.
“No?” the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and the brain.
It was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever. The old man reversed the oar and
put the blade between the shark’s jaws to open them. He twisted the blade and as the
shark slid loose he said, “Go on, galano. Slide down a mile deep. Go see your friend, or
maybe it’s your mother.”
The old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar. Then he found the
sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course.
[109] “They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat,” he said aloud. “I
wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I’m sorry about it, fish. It makes
everything wrong.” He stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now. Drained of
blood and awash he looked the colour of the silver backing of a minor and his stripes still
showed.
“I shouldn’t have gone out so far, fish,” he said. “Neither for you nor for me. I’m
sorry, fish.”
Now, he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut.
Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.
“I wish I had a stone for the knife,” the old man said after he had checked the lashing
on the oar butt. “I should have brought a stone.” You should have brought many things,
he thought. But you did not bring them, old man. Now is no time to think of what you do
not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.
“You give me much good counsel,” he said aloud. “I’m tired of it.” He held the tiller
under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove forward. “God
knows how much that last one took,” he said.
[110] “But she’s much lighter now.” He did not want to think of the mutilated
under-side of the fish. He knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been
meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway
through the sea.
He was a fish to keep a man all winter, he thought Don’t think of that. Just rest and
try to get your hands in shape to defend what is left of him. The blood smell from my
hands means nothing now with all that scent in the water. Besides they do not bleed
much. There is nothing cut that means anything. The bleeding may keep the left from
cramping.
What can I think of now? he thought. Nothing. I must think of nothing and wait for

the next ones. I wish it had really been a dream, he thought. But who knows? It might
have turned out well.
The next shark that came was a single shovelnose. He came like a pig to the trough if
a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it. The old man let him hit the
fish and then drove the knife on the oar don into his brain. But the shark jerked
backwards as he rolled and the knife blade snapped.
The old man settled himself to steer. He did not even watch the big shark sinking
slowly in the water, [111] showing first life-size, then small, then tiny. That always
fascinated the old man. But he did not even watch it now.
“I have the gaff now,” he said. “But it will do no good. I have the two oars and the
tiller and the short club.”
Now they have beaten me, he thought. I am too old to club sharks to death. But I will
try it as long as I have the oars and the short club and the tiller.
He put his hands in the water again to soak them. It was getting late in the afternoon
and he saw nothing but the sea and the sky. There was more wind in the sky than there
had been, and soon he hoped that he would see land.
“You’re tired, old man,” he said. “You’re tired inside.”
The sharks did not hit him again until just before sunset.
The old man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in
the water.
They were not even quartering on the scent. They were headed straight for the skiff
swimming side by side. He jammed the tiller, made the sheet fast and reached under the
stem for the club. It was an oar handle [112] from a broken oar sawed off to about two
and a half feet in length. He could only use it
effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold of
it with his right hand, flexing his hand on it, as he watched the sharks come. They were
both galanos.
I must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or
straight across the top of the head, he thought.
The two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and
sink them into the silver side of the fish, he raised the club high and brought it down
heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark’s broad head. He felt the rubbery solidity
as the club came down. But he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once
more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish.
The other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide. The
old man could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws
as he bumped the fish and closed his jaws. He swung at him and hit only the head and the
shark looked at him and wrenched the meat loose. The [113] old man swung the club

down on him again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid
rubberiness.
“Come on, galano,” the old man said. “Come in again.”
The shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws. He hit him
solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club. This time he felt the bone at the
base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat
loose sluggishly and slid down from the fish.
The old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed. Then he saw
one on the surface swimming in circles. He did not see the fin of the other.
I could not expect to kill them, he thought. I could have in my time. But I have hurt
them both badly and neither one can feel very good. If I could have used a bat with two
hands I could have killed the first one surely. Even now, he thought.
He did not want to look at the fish. He knew that half of him had been destroyed.
The sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks.
“It will be dark soon,” he said. “Then I should see [114] the glow of Havana.. If I am
too far to the eastward I will see the lights of one of the new beaches.”
I cannot be too far out now, he thought. I hope no one has been too worried. There is
only the boy to worry, of course. But I am sure he would have confidence. Many of the
older fishermen will worry. Many others too, he thought. I live in a good town.
He could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly.
Then something came into his head.
“Half fish,” he said. “Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too far out. I ruined
us both. But we have killed many sharks, you and I, and ruined many others. How many
did you ever kill, old fish? You do not have that spear on your head for nothing.”
He liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swimming
free. I should have chopped the bill off to fight them with, he thought. But there was no
hatchet and then there was no knife.
But if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon. Then we might
have fought them together. What will you do now if they come in the night? What can you
do?
“Fight them,” he said. “I’ll fight them until I die.”
[115] But in the dark now and no glow showing and no lights and only the wind and
the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was already dead. He put his two hands
together and felt the palms. They were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by
simply opening and closing them. He leaned his back against the stern and knew he was
not dead. His shoulders told him.
I have all those prayers I promised if I caught the fish, he thought. But I am too tired

to say them now. I better get the sack and put it over my shoulders.
He lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky. I have
half of him, he thought. Maybe I’ll have the luck to bring the forward half in. I should
have some luck. No, he said. You violated your luck when you went too far outside.
“Don’t be silly,” he said aloud. “And keep awake and steer. You may have much luck
yet.”
“I’d like to buy some if there’s any place they sell it,” he said.
What could I buy it with? he asked himself. Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a
broken knife and two bad hands?
“You might,” he said. “You tried to buy it with [116] eighty-four days at sea. They
nearly sold it to you too.”
I must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and
who can recognize her? I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked. I
wish I could see the glow from the lights, he thought. I wish too many things. But that is
the thing I wish for now. He tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain he
knew he was not dead.
He saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten
o’clock at night. They were only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the
moon rises. Then they were steady to see across the ocean which was rough now with the
increasing breeze. He steered inside of the glow and he thought that now, soon, he must
hit the edge of the stream.
Now it is over, he thought. They will probably hit me again. But what can a man do
against them in the dark without a weapon?
He was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body
hurt with the cold of the night. I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought. I hope so
much I do not have to fight again.
[117] But by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless. They
came in a pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their
phosphorescence as they threw themselves on the fish. He clubbed at heads and heard
the jaws chop and the shaking of the skiff as they took hold below. He clubbed
desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it
was gone.
He jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it, holding it in
both hands and driving it down again and again. But they were up to the bow now and
driving in one after the other and together, tearing off the pieces of meat that showed
glowing below the sea as they turned to come once more.
One came, finally, against the head itself and he knew that it was over. He swung the
tiller across the shark’s head where the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fish’s
head which would not tear. He swung it once and twice and again. He heard the tiller

break and he lunged at the shark with the splintered butt. He felt it go in and knowing it
was sharp he drove it in again. The shark let go and rolled away. That was the [118] last
shark of the pack that came. There was nothing more for them to eat.
The old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth. It
was coppery and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment. But there was not much of
it.
He spat into the ocean and said, “Eat that, galanos. And make a dream you’ve killed
a man.”
He knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back to the
stern and found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough
for him to steer. He settled the sack around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course.
He sailed lightly now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind. He was past
everything now and he sailed the skiff to make his home port as well and as intelligently
as he could. In the night sharks hit the carcass as someone might pick up crumbs from
the table. The old man paid no attention to them and did not pay any attention to
anything except steering. He only noticed how lightly and bow well the skiff sailed now
there was no great weight beside her.
[119] She’s good, he thought. She is sound and not harmed in any way except for the
tiller. That is easily replaced. He could feel he was inside the current now and he could
see the lights of the beach colonies along the shore. He knew where he was now and it
was nothing to get home.
The wind is our friend, anyway, he thought. Then he added, sometimes. And the
great sea with our friends and our enemies. And bed, he thought. Bed is my friend. Just
bed, he thought. Bed will be a great thing. It is easy when you are beaten, he thought. I
never knew how easy it was. And what beat you, he thought.
“Nothing,” he said aloud. “I went out too far.”
When he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the Terrace were out and he knew
everyone was in bed. The breeze had risen steadily and was blowing strongly now. It was
quiet in the harbour though and he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the
rocks. There was no one to help him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could. Then he
stepped out and made her fast to a rock.
[120] He unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it. Then he shouldered the
mast and started to climb. It was then he knew the depth of his tiredness. He stopped for
a moment and looked back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of
the fish standing up well behind the skiff’s stern. He saw the white naked line of his
backbone and the dark mass of the head with the projecting bill and all the nakedness
between.
He started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast
across his shoulder. He tried to get up. But it was too difficult and he sat there with the
mast on his shoulder and looked at the road. A cat passed on the far side going about its
business and the old man watched it. Then he just watched the road.

Finally he put the mast down and stood up. He picked the mast up and put it on his
shoulder and started up the road. He had to sit down five times before he reached his
shack.
Inside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall. In the dark he found a water
bottle and took a drink. Then he lay down on the bed. He pulled the blanket [121] over his
shoulders and then over his back and legs and he slept face down on the newspapers with
his arms out straight and the palms of his hands up.
He was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning. It was blowing so
hard that the drifting-boats would not be going out and the boy had slept late and then
come to the old man’s shack as he had come each morning. The boy saw that the old man
was breathing and then he saw the old man’s hands and he started to cry. He went out
very quietly to go to bring some coffee and all the way down the road he was crying.
Many fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside it and one
was in the water, his trousers rolled up, measuring the skeleton with a length of line.
The boy did not go down. He had been there before and one of the fishermen was
looking after the skiff for him. “How is he?” one of the fishermen shouted. “Sleeping,” the
boy called. He did not care that they saw him crying. “Let no one disturb him.” “He was
eighteen feet from nose to tail,” the fisherman who was measuring him called.
[122] “I believe it,” the boy said.
He went into the Terrace and asked for a can of coffee.
“Hot and with plenty of milk and sugar in it.”
“Anything more?”
“No. Afterwards I will see what he can eat.”
“What a fish it was,” the proprietor said. “There has never been such a fish. Those
were two fine fish you took yesterday too.” “Damn my fish,” the boy said and he started to
cry again.
“Do you want a drink of any kind?” the proprietor asked.
“No,” the boy said. “Tell them not to bother Santiago. I’ll be back.”
“Tell him how sorry I am.”
“Thanks,” the boy said.
The boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man’s shack and sat by him until
he woke. Once it looked as though he were waking. But he had gone back into heavy sleep
and the boy had gone across the road to borrow some wood to heat the coffee.
Finally the old man woke.
[123] “Don’t sit up,” the boy said. “Drink this.”

He poured some of the coffee in a glass.
The old man took it and drank it.
“They beat me, Manolin,” he said. “They truly beat me.”
“He didn’t beat you. Not the fish.”
“No. Truly. It was afterwards.”
“Pedrico is looking after the skiff and the gear. What do you want done with the
head?”
“Let Pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps.”
“And the spear?”
“You keep it if you want it.”
“I want it,” the boy said. “Now we must make our plans about the other things.”
“Did they search for me?”
“Of course. With coast guard and with planes.”
“The ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see,” the old man said. He
noticed how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to instead of speaking only to
himself and to the sea. “I missed you,” he said. “What did you catch?” “One the first day.
One the second and two the third.”
[124] “Very good.”
“Now we fish together again.”
“No. I am not lucky. I am not lucky anymore.”
“The hell with luck,” the boy said. “I’ll bring the luck with me.”
“What will your family say?”
“I do not care. I caught two yesterday. But we will fish together now for I still have
much to learn.”
“We must get a good killing lance and always have it on board. You can make the
blade from a spring leaf from an old Ford. We can grind it in Guanabacoa. It should be
sharp and not tempered so it will break. My knife broke.”
“I’ll get another knife and have the spring ground.”
How many days of heavy brisa have we?”
“Maybe three. Maybe more.”
“I will have everything in order,” the boy said. “You get your hands well old man.”

“I know how to care for them. In the night I spat something strange and felt
something in my chest was broken.” “Get that well too,” the boy said. “Lie down, old man,
and I will bring you your clean shirt. And something to eat.”
[125] “Bring any of the papers of the time that I was gone,” the old man said.
“You must get well fast for there is much that I can learn and you can teach me
everything.
How much did you suffer?” “Plenty,” the old man said.
“I’ll bring the food and the papers,” the boy said. “Rest well, old man. I will bring
stuff from the drugstore for your hands.”
“Don’t forget to tell Pedrico the head is his.”
“No. I will remember.”
As the boy went out the door and down the worn coral rock road he was crying again.
That afternoon there was a party of tourists at the Terrace and looking down in the
water among the empty beer cans and dead barracudas a woman saw a great long white
spine with a huge tail at the end that lifted and swung with the tide while the east wind
blew a heavy steady sea outside the entrance to the harbour.
“What’s that?” she asked a waiter and pointed to the long backbone of the great fish
that was now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide.
“Tiburon,” the waiter said. “Shark.” He was meaning to explain what had happened.
“I didn’t know sharks had such handsome, beautifully formed tails.”
“I didn’t either,” her male companion said.
Up the road, in his shack, the old man was sleeping again. He was still sleeping on
his face and the boy was sitting by him watching him. The old man was dreaming about
the lions.

Ernest Hemingway, Writer
• Born: 21 July 1899
• Birthplace: Oak Park, Illinois
• Died: 2 July 1961 (suicide)
• Best Known As: Famously manly author of For Whom the Bell
Tolls
Hemingway is one of the 20th century's most famous American writers. His
books include The Sun Also Rises (1926), A Farewell to Arms (1929), and For
Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Hemingway's plainspoken no-frills writing style
became so famous that it was (and is) frequently parodied. His dashing
machismo was almost as famous as his writing: he lived in Paris, Cuba and Key
West, fancied bullfighting and big game hunting, and served as a war
correspondent in WWII and the Spanish Civil War. He sealed his own notoriety
when he killed himself with a shotgun in 1961.
Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954...
Hemingway is sometimes called by his familiar nickname "Papa"... His
birthdate is sometimes listed in error as 1898. According to a 1954 article in the
New York Times, "In most reference books and in his own conversation he is
one year older because he gave 1898 as his birth date when he tried to enlist [in
the army] early in 1917, and stuck to that date ever since"... Hemingway's father
also committed suicide, shooting himself with a Civil War pistol in 1928.

The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway
www.Asiaing.com
To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

1. Introduction
A fundamental problem that makes language modeling and other learning problems difficult is the
curse of dimensionality. It is particularly obvious in the case when one wants to model the joint
distribution between many discrete random variables (such as words in a sentence, or discrete at-
tributes in a data-mining task). For example, if one wants to model the joint distribution of 10
consecutive words in a natural language with a vocabularyV of size 100,000, there are potentially
10000010−1 =1050−1 free parameters. When modeling continuous variables, we obtain gen-
eralization more easily (e.g. with smooth classes of functions like multi-layer neural networks or
Gaussian mixture models) because the function to be learned can be expected to have some lo-
cal smoothness properties. For discrete spaces, the generalization structure is not as obvious: any

show in this paper that the way in which the approach proposed here generalizes is fundamentally
different from the way in which previous state-of-the-art statistical language modeling approaches
aregeneralizing.
A statistical model of language can be represented by the conditional probability of the next
wordgivenalltheprevious ones,since
T
Pˆ(wT)=(cid:213) Pˆ(w jwt−1),
1 t 1
t=1
where w
t
is the t-th word, and writing sub-sequence w ij = (w i,w i+1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),w j−1,w j). Such statisti-
cal language models have already been found useful in many technological applications involving
natural language, such as speech recognition, language translation, and information retrieval. Im-
provementsinstatisticallanguagemodelscouldthushaveasignificantimpactonsuchapplications.
When building statistical models of natural language, one considerably reduces the difficulty
of this modeling problem by taking advantage of word order, and the fact that temporally closer
words in the word sequence are statistically more dependent. Thus, n-gram models construct ta-
bles of conditional probabilities for the next word, for each one of a large number of contexts, i.e.
combinations ofthelastn−1words:
Pˆ(w jwt−1)(cid:25)Pˆ(w jwt−1 ).
t 1 t t−n+1
We only consider those combinations of successive words that actually occur in the training cor-
pus, or that occur frequently enough. What happens when a new combination of n words appears
that was not seen in the training corpus? We do not want to assign zero probability to such cases,
because such new combinations are likely to occur, and they will occur even more frequently for
larger contextsizes. Asimpleansweristolookattheprobability predicted usingasmallercontext
size,asdoneinback-offtrigrammodels(Katz,1987)orinsmoothed(orinterpolated)trigrammod-
els (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980). So, in such models, how is generalization basically obtained from
sequences of words seen in the training corpus to new sequences of words? A way to understand
how thishappens istothink about agenerative modelcorresponding tothese interpolated orback-
off n-gram models. Essentially, a new sequence of words is generated by “gluing” very short and
overlapping pieces oflength 1, 2... orup to nwords that have been seen frequently in thetraining
data. The rules for obtaining the probability of the next piece are implicit in the particulars of the
back-off or interpolated n-gram algorithm. Typically researchers have used n =3, i.e. trigrams,
and obtained state-of-the-art results, but see Goodman (2001) for how combining many tricks can
yield to substantial improvements. Obviously there ismuch moreinformation inthe sequence that
immediately precedes the word to predict than just the identity of the previous couple of words.
There are atleast two characteristics in this approach which begto be improved upon, and that we

 A NEURAL PROBABILISTIC LANGUAGE MODEL
will focus on in this paper. First, it is not taking into account contexts farther than 1 or 2 words,1
second it is not taking into account the “similarity” between words. For example, having seen the
sentence “The cat is walking in the bedroom” in the training corpus should help us gener-
alize to make the sentence “A dog was running in a room” almost as likely, simply because
“dog” and “cat” (resp. “the” and “a”, “room” and “bedroom”, etc...) have similar semantic and
grammaticalroles.
There are many approaches that have been proposed to address these two issues, and we will
briefly explain in Section 1.2 the relations between the approach proposed here and some of these
earlier approaches. We will first discuss what is the basic idea of the proposed approach. A more
formal presentation will follow in Section 2, using an implementation of these ideas that relies
on shared-parameter multi-layer neural networks. Another contribution of this paper concerns the
challenge of training such very large neural networks (with millions of parameters) for very large
data sets (with millions or tens of millions of examples). Finally, an important contribution of
this paper is to show that training such large-scale model is expensive but feasible, scales to large
contexts, andyieldsgoodcomparativeresults(Section4).

1.1 FightingtheCurseofDimensionalitywithDistributedRepresentations
Inanutshell, theideaoftheproposed approach canbesummarizedasfollows:
1. associate with each word in the vocabulary a distributed word feature vector (a real-
valuedvectorinRm),
2. express the joint probability function of word sequences in terms of the feature vectors
ofthesewordsinthesequence, and
3. learn simultaneously the word feature vectors and the parameters of that probability
function.
Thefeaturevectorrepresentsdifferentaspectsoftheword: eachwordisassociatedwithapoint
in a vector space. The number of features (e.g. m =30, 60 or 100 in the experiments) is much
smaller than the size of the vocabulary (e.g. 17,000). The probability function is expressed as a
product of conditional probabilities of the next word given the previous ones, (e.g. using a multi-
layer neural network to predict the next word given the previous ones, in the experiments). This
function has parameters that can be iteratively tuned in order to maximize the log-likelihood of
the training data or a regularized criterion, e.g. by adding a weight decay penalty.2 The feature
vectors associated with each word are learned, but they could be initialized using prior knowledge
ofsemanticfeatures.
Why does it work? In the previous example, if we knew that dog and cat played simi-
lar roles (semantically and syntactically), and similarly for (the,a), (bedroom,room), (is,was),
1.n-gramswithnupto5(i.e.4wordsofcontext)havebeenreported,though,butduetodatascarcity,mostpredictions

andmanyothercombinations. Intheproposedmodel,itwillsogeneralizebecause“similar”words
are expected to have a similar feature vector, and because the probability function is a smooth
function of these feature values, a small change in the features will induce a small change in the
probability. Therefore, the presence ofonly oneofthe abovesentences inthetraining datawillin-
creasetheprobability,notonlyofthatsentence,butalsoofitscombinatorialnumberof“neighbors”

1.2 RelationtoPreviousWork

beenfound useful tolearnthejoint probability of Z (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)Z ,asetofrandom variables whereeachis
1 n
possibly of a different nature (Bengio and Bengio, 2000a,b). In that model, the joint probability is
decomposed asaproductofconditional probabilities
Pˆ(Z 1=z 1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),Z n=z n)=(cid:213) Pˆ(Z i=z ijg i(Z i−1=z i−1,Z i−2=z i−2,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),Z 1=z 1)),
i
where g(.) is a function represented by a neural network with a special left-to-right architecture,
with the i-th output block g() computing parameters for expressing the conditional distribution of
i
Z given the value of the previous Z’s, in some arbitrary order. Experiments on four UCIdata sets

show thisapproach toworkcomparatively verywell(Bengio andBengio, 2000a,b). Herewemust
deal with data of variable length, like sentences, so the above approach must be adapted. Another

1990). Morerecently, Hinton’s approach wasimproved andsuccessfully demonstrated onlearning
several symbolic relations (Paccanaro and Hinton, 2000). The idea of using neural networks for

related to previous proposals of character-based text compression using neural networks to predict

ofcharacterizing thesimilaritywithadiscreterandomordeterministicvariable(whichcorresponds
to a soft or hard partition of the set of words), we use a continuous real-vector for each word, i.e.
a learned distributed feature vector, to represent similarity between words. The experimental

Indexing, see Deerwester et al., 1990). An important difference is that here we look for a repre-
sentation for words that is helpful in representing compactly the probability distribution of word
sequences from natural language text. Experiments suggest that learning jointly the representation

In the above model, the number of free parameters onlyscales linearly withV, the number of
words in the vocabulary. It also only scales linearly with the order n : the scaling factor could
be reduced to sub-linear if more sharing structure were introduced, e.g. using a time-delay neural
networkorarecurrent neuralnetwork(oracombination ofboth).

combining the probability predictions of the neural network with those of an interpolated trigram
model, either with a simple fixed weight of 0.5, a learned weight (maximum likelihood on the

sameprocedure thatcombines trigram, bigram, andunigram intheinterpolated trigram, whichisa

3. ParallelImplementation
Althoughthenumberofparametersscalesnicely,i.e. linearlywiththesizeoftheinputwindowand
linearlywiththesizeofthevocabulary,theamountofcomputationrequiredforobtainingtheoutput
probabilities is much greater than that required from n-gram models. The main reason is that with
n-gram models, obtaining a particular P(w tjw t−1,...,w t−n+1) does not require the computation of
the probabilities for all the words in the vocabulary, because of the easy normalization (performed
when training the model) enjoyed by the linear combinations of relative frequencies. The main
computational bottleneck with the neural implementation is the computation of the activations of
theoutputlayer.

Runningthemodel(bothtrainingandtesting)onaparallelcomputerisawaytoreducecompu-
tation time. Wehaveexplored parallelization ontwotypesofplatforms: shared-memory processor
machinesandLinuxclusterswithafastnetwork.
3.1 Data-Parallel Processing
Inthecaseofashared-memory processor, parallelization iseasilyachieved, thanks totheverylow
communication overhead between processors, through the shared memory. In that case we have
chosen a data-parallel implementation in which each processor works on a different subset of
thedata. Eachprocessor computes thegradient foritsexamples, and performs stochastic gradient
updates on the parameters of the model, which are simply stored in a shared-memory area. Our
first implementation was extremely slow and relied on synchronization commands to make sure
that each processor would not write atthe same time asanother one in one ofthe above parameter
subsets. Mostofthe cycles ofeach processor werespent waiting foranother processor torelease a
lockonthewriteaccesstotheparameters.
Instead we have chosen an asynchronous implementation where each processor can write at
anytimeintheshared-memory area. Sometimes, part ofanupdate on theparameter vector byone
of the processors is lost, being overwritten by the update of another processor, and this introduces
a bit of noise in the parameter updates. However, this noise seems to be very small and did not
apparently slowdowntraining.
Unfortunately, large shared-memory parallel computers are very expensive and their processor
speed tends to lag behind mainstream CPUs that can be connected in clusters. We have thus been
abletoobtainmuchfastertraining onfastnetworkclusters.
3.2 Parameter-Parallel Processing
If the parallel computer is a network of CPUs, we generally can’t afford to frequently exchange
all the parameters among the processors, because that represents tens of megabytes (almost 100
megabytes in the case of our largest network), which would take too much time through a local
network. Instead we have chosen to parallelize across the parameters, in particular the parame-
ters of the output units, because that is where the vast majority of the computation is taking place,
in our architecture. Each CPU is responsible for the computation of the unnormalized probability
for a subset of the outputs, and performs the updates for the corresponding output unit parame-
ters (weights going into that unit). This strategy allowed us to perform a parallelized stochastic
gradientascentwithanegligiblecommunicationoverhead. TheCPUsessentiallyneedtocommu-
nicate two informations: (1) the normalization factor of the output softmax, and (2) the gradients
on the hidden layer (denoted a below) and word feature layer (denoted x). Allthe CPUsduplicate
the computations that precede the computation of the output units activations, i.e., the selection of
word features and the computation of the hidden layer activation a, as well as the corresponding
back-propagation and update steps. However, these computations are a negligible part of the total
computation forournetworks.
Forexample,considerthefollowingarchitectureusedintheexperimentsontheAP(Associated
Press)newsdata: thevocabularysizeisjVj=17,964,thenumberofhiddenunitsish=60,theorder

feature units). In this example the fraction of the overall computation required for computing the
weighted sums of the output units is therefore approximately jVj(1+(n−1)m+h) =
jVj(1+(n−1)m+h)+h(1+(n−1)m)+(n−1)m
99.7%. This calculation is approximate because the actual CPU time associated with different
operations differ, but it shows that it is generally advantageous to parallelize the output units com-
putation. ThefactthatallCPUswillduplicateaverysmallfractionofthecomputationsisnotgoing
to hurt the total computation time for the level of parallelization sought here, i.e. of a few dozen
processors. If the number of hidden units was large, parallelizing their computation would also
becomeprofitable, butwedidnotinvestigate thatapproach inourexperiments.

The validation set was used to choose the order of the n-gram and the number of word classes for
theclass-basedmodels. WeusedtheimplementationofthesealgorithmsintheSRILanguageMod-

fitting(onthevalidationset),possiblybecauseweranonly5epochs(over3weeksusing40CPUs).
Early stopping on the validation set was used, but was necessary only in our Brown experiments.
A weight decay penalty of
10−4
was used in the Brown experiments and a weight decay of
10−5
wasused inthe APNewsexperiments (selected by afew trials, based on validation set perplexity).
Table 1 summarizes the results obtained on the Brown corpus. All the back-off models of the
table are modified Kneser-Ney n-grams, which worked significantly better than standard back-off
models. When m is specified for a back-off model in the table, a class-based n-gram is used (m
is the number of word classes). Random initialization of the word features was done (similarly to
initialization ofneuralnetworkweights),butwesuspectthatbetterresultsmightbeobtainedwitha
knowledge-based initialization.
The main result is that significantly better results can be obtained when using the neural net-
work,incomparisonwiththebestofthen-grams,withatestperplexitydifferenceofabout24%on
Brownandabout8%onAPNews,whentakingtheMLPversusthen-gramthatworkedbestonthe
validation set. The table also suggests that the neural network was able to take advantage of more
context (on Brown, going from 2 words of context to 4 words brought improvements to the neural
network, not to the n-grams). It also shows that the hidden units are useful (MLP3 vs MLP1 and
MLP4 vs MLP2), and that mixing the output probabilities of the neural network with the interpo-
lated trigram always helps to reduce perplexity. The fact that simple averaging helps suggests that
the neural network and the trigram make errors (i.e. lowprobability given to anobserved word) in
differentplaces. Theresultsdonotallowtosaywhetherthedirectconnections frominputtooutput

Hinton’srecent workonproducts ofexperts(Hinton, 2000). Intheneural networkdescribed inthe
previous sections the distributed word features are used only for the “input” words and not for the
“output” word (next word). Furthermore, a very large number of parameters (the majority) are
expanded in the output layer: the semantic or syntactic similarities between output words are not
exploited. In the variant described here, the output word is also represented by its feature vector.
The network takes in input a sub-sequence of words (mapped to their feature vectors) and outputs
an energy function E which is low when the words form a likely sub-sequence, high when it is
unlikely. Forexample,thenetworkoutputs an“energy” function

of hidden units biases, v is the output weight vector, and H is the hidden layer weight matrix, and

x=(C(w t),C(w t−1),C(w t−2),(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),C(w t−n+1).

Note that the total amount of computation is comparable to the architecture presented earlier, and
the number of parameters can also be matched if the v parameter is indexed by the identity of the
target word (w ). Note that only b remains after the above softmax normalization (any linear

the computation of the gradient is tractable. This is not the case for example with products-of-
HMMs (Brown and Hinton, 2000), in which the product is over experts that view the whole se-
quence, and which can be trained with approximate gradient algorithms such as the contrastive
divergence algorithm (Brown and Hinton, 2000). Note also that this architecture and the products-
of-experts formulation can be seen as extensions of the very successful Maximum Entropy mod-
els (Berger et al., 1996), but where the basis functions (or “features”, here the hidden units acti-
vations) are learned by penalized maximum likelihood at the same time as the parameters of the
features linear combination, instead of being learned in an outer loop, with greedy feature subset
selection methods.
We have implemented and experimented with the above architecture, and have developed a
speed-up technique for the neural network training, based on importance sampling and yielding a
100-fold speed-up (BengioandSenécal, 2003).

3. Propagating gradients only from a subset of the output words. It could be the words that
are conditionally most likely (based on a faster model such as a trigram, see Schwenk and
Gauvain, 2002,foranapplication ofthisidea), oritcouldbeasubset ofthewordsforwhich
the trigram has been found to perform poorly. If the language model is coupled to a speech
recognizer, then only the scores (unnormalized probabilities) of the acoustically ambiguous
words need to be computed. See also Bengio and Senécal (2003) for a new accelerated
training methodusingimportance samplingtoselectthewords.

4. Introducing a-priori knowledge. Severalformsofsuch knowledge could beintroduced, such
as: semantic information (e.g., from WordNet, see Fellbaum, 1998), low-level grammatical
information (e.g., using parts-of-speech), and high-level grammatical information, e.g., cou-
plingthemodeltoastochastic grammar,assuggested inBengio(2002). Theeffectoflonger
term context could be captured by introducing more structure and parameter sharing in the
neural network, e.g. using time-delay or recurrent neural networks. In such a multi-layered
networkthecomputationthathasbeenperformedforsmallgroupsofconsecutivewordsdoes
not need to be redone when the network input window is shifted. Similarly, one could use a
recurrentnetworktocapturepotentiallyevenlongerterminformationaboutthesubjectofthe
text.
5. Interpreting (and possibly using) the word feature representation learned by the neural net-
work. A simple first step would start with m = 2 features, which can be more easily dis-
played. Webelieve that more meaningful representations willrequire large training corpora,
especially forlargervaluesofm.
6. Polysemous words are probably not well served by the model presented here, which assigns
toeachwordasinglepointinacontinuoussemanticspace. Weareinvestigatingextensionsof
thismodelinwhicheachwordisassociatedwithmultiplepointsinthatspace,eachassociated
withthedifferent sensesoftheword.
6. Conclusion
The experiments on two corpora, one with more than a million examples, and a larger one with
above15millionwords,haveshownthattheproposed approach yields muchbetterperplexity than
astate-of-the-artmethod,thesmoothedtrigram,withdifferencesbetween10and20%inperplexity.
We believe that the main reason for these improvements is that the proposed approach allows
totake advantage ofthelearned distributed representation tofightthecurse ofdimensionality with
itsownweapons: each training sentence informs themodel about acombinatorial number ofother
sentences.
There is probably much more to be done to improve the model, at the level of architecture,
computational efficiency, andtakingadvantage ofpriorknowledge. Animportant priorityoffuture
research should be to improve speed-up techniques5 as well as ways to increase capacity without
increasingtrainingtimetoomuch(todealwithcorporawithhundredsofmillionsofwordsormore).

1. Introduction
A fundamental problem that makes language modeling and other learning problems difficult is the
curse of dimensionality. It is particularly obvious in the case when one wants to model the joint
distribution between many discrete random variables (such as words in a sentence, or discrete at-
tributes in a data-mining task). For example, if one wants to model the joint distribution of 10
consecutive words in a natural language with a vocabularyV of size 100,000, there are potentially
10000010−1 =1050−1 free parameters. When modeling continuous variables, we obtain gen-
eralization more easily (e.g. with smooth classes of functions like multi-layer neural networks or
Gaussian mixture models) because the function to be learned can be expected to have some lo-
cal smoothness properties. For discrete spaces, the generalization structure is not as obvious: any
change ofthesediscrete variables mayhaveadrastic impactonthevalueofthefunction tobeesti-

摘要
统计语言建模的目标是学习语言中单词序列的联合概率函数。这在本质上是困难的，因为维度的诅咒：测试模型的单词序列很可能与训练过程中出现的所有单词序列不同。传统但非常成功的方法是基于n-gram，并通过连接在训练集中见过的非常短的重叠序列来获得泛化。我们提出通过学习一种分布式表示来对抗维度的诅咒，这种表示允许每个训练句子向模型提供有关大量语义相关句子的信息。该模型同时学习每个单词的分布式表示以及单词序列的概率函数，以这些表示的形式表达。通过这种方式，当组成一个以前未见过的单词序列的单词类似（在具有相似表示的意义上）于构成一个已经见过的句子时，该序列获得高概率。在合理的时间内训练这样大型的模型（具有数百万个参数）本身就是一个重大挑战。我们报告了使用神经网络进行概率函数的实验，在两个文本语料库上显示出所提出的方法显著改善了当前n-gram模型，并且所提出的方法允许利用更长的上下文。
关键词：统计语言建模，人工神经网络，分布式表示，维度的诅咒
1.引言
一种使语言建模和其他学习问题困难的基本问题是维度的诅咒。当我们想要对许多离散随机变量之间的联合分布进行建模时（例如句子中的单词或数据挖掘任务中的离散属性），这一问题尤为明显。例如，如果我们想要对自然语言中具有大小为100,000的词汇V的10个连续单词的联合分布进行建模，那么潜在的自由参数可能有100000^10−1 = 10^50−1个。在建模连续变量时，我们可以更容易地获得泛化（例如，使用光滑函数类，如多层神经网络或高斯混合模型），因为可以预期要学习的函数具有一些局部平滑性质。对于离散空间，泛化结构并不那么明显：这些离散变量的任何变化可能会对函数的值产生重大影响。

mass where it matters rather than uniformly in all directions around each training point. We will
show in this paper that the way in which the approach proposed here generalizes is fundamentally
different from the way in which previous state-of-the-art statistical language modeling approaches
aregeneralizing.
A statistical model of language can be represented by the conditional probability of the next
wordgivenalltheprevious ones,since
T
Pˆ(wT)=(cid:213) Pˆ(w jwt−1),
1 t 1
t=1
where w
t
is the t-th word, and writing sub-sequence w ij = (w i,w i+1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),w j−1,w j). Such statisti-
cal language models have already been found useful in many technological applications involving
natural language, such as speech recognition, language translation, and information retrieval. Im-
provementsinstatisticallanguagemodelscouldthushaveasignificantimpactonsuchapplications.
When building statistical models of natural language, one considerably reduces the difficulty
of this modeling problem by taking advantage of word order, and the fact that temporally closer
words in the word sequence are statistically more dependent. Thus, n-gram models construct ta-
bles of conditional probabilities for the next word, for each one of a large number of contexts, i.e.
combinations ofthelastn−1words:
Pˆ(w jwt−1)(cid:25)Pˆ(w jwt−1 ).
t 1 t t−n+1
We only consider those combinations of successive words that actually occur in the training cor-
pus, or that occur frequently enough. What happens when a new combination of n words appears
that was not seen in the training corpus? We do not want to assign zero probability to such cases,
because such new combinations are likely to occur, and they will occur even more frequently for
larger contextsizes. Asimpleansweristolookattheprobability predicted usingasmallercontext
size,asdoneinback-offtrigrammodels(Katz,1987)orinsmoothed(orinterpolated)trigrammod-
els (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980). So, in such models, how is generalization basically obtained from
sequences of words seen in the training corpus to new sequences of words? A way to understand
how thishappens istothink about agenerative modelcorresponding tothese interpolated orback-
off n-gram models. Essentially, a new sequence of words is generated by “gluing” very short and
overlapping pieces oflength 1, 2... orup to nwords that have been seen frequently in thetraining
data. The rules for obtaining the probability of the next piece are implicit in the particulars of the
back-off or interpolated n-gram algorithm. Typically researchers have used n =3, i.e. trigrams,
and obtained state-of-the-art results, but see Goodman (2001) for how combining many tricks can
yield to substantial improvements. Obviously there ismuch moreinformation inthe sequence that
immediately precedes the word to predict than just the identity of the previous couple of words.

一种有用的方法来可视化不同学习算法如何泛化，受到非参数密度估计的启发，就是思考一开始集中在训练点（例如训练句子）上的概率质量是如何分布在更大的体积中的，通常是在训练点周围的某种形式的邻域内。在高维空间中，关键是将概率质量分布在重要的地方，而不是均匀地在每个训练点周围的所有方向。本文将展示这里提出的方法如何泛化，与先前现有的统计语言建模方法泛化的方式有根本不同。
语言的统计模型可以通过给定所有之前的单词来表示下一个单词的条件概率，即
T
Pˆ(wT)=(cid:213) Pˆ(w jwt−1),
1 t 1
t=1
其中 w
t
是第 t 个单词，写子序列 w ij = (w i,w i+1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),w j−1,w j)。这种统计语言模型已经在许多涉及自然语言的技术应用中被证明是有用的，例如语音识别、语言翻译和信息检索。因此，改进统计语言模型可能会对这些应用产生重要影响。
建立自然语言的统计模型时，通过利用单词顺序和临时更接近的单词在单词序列中统计上更相关的事实，极大地减少了建模问题的困难。因此，n-gram模型为每个大量上下文（即最后n-1个单词的组合）构建下一个单词的条件概率表。
我们只考虑训练语料库中实际出现或出现频率足够高的连续单词组合。当在训练语料库中出现一个新的 n 个单词组合时会发生什么？我们不希望为这种情况分配零概率，因为这种新组合很可能会发生，并且对于更大的上下文大小来说它们会更加频繁地发生。一个简单的答案是查看使用较小的上下文大小预测的概率，就像在后退三元模型（Katz, 1987）或平滑（或插值）三元模型（Jelinek and Mercer, 1980）中所做的那样。因此，在这些模型中，如何从训练语料库中看到的单词序列的泛化基本上是如何到达新的单词序列的？理解这是如何发生的一种方法是考虑与这些插值或后退 n-gram 模型对应的生成模型。基本上，一个新的单词序列是通过“粘合”在训练数据中频繁出现的非常短且重叠的长度为 1、2... 或最多 n 个单词的部件生成的。获得下一个部分的概率的规则隐含在后退或插值 n-gram 算法的细节中。通常研究人员使用 n =3，即三元组，并获得最先进的结果，但请参见 Goodman（2001）有关如何结合许多技巧可以产生重大改进的信息。显然，与仅仅是前面的几个单词的身份相比，紧接着要预测的单词之前的序列中有更多的信息。
在这种方法中至少有两个特点值得改进，我们将在接下来的研究中深入探讨。

will focus on in this paper. First, it is not taking into account contexts farther than 1 or 2 words,1
second it is not taking into account the “similarity” between words. For example, having seen the
sentence “The cat is walking in the bedroom” in the training corpus should help us gener-
alize to make the sentence “A dog was running in a room” almost as likely, simply because
“dog” and “cat” (resp. “the” and “a”, “room” and “bedroom”, etc...) have similar semantic and
grammaticalroles.
There are many approaches that have been proposed to address these two issues, and we will
briefly explain in Section 1.2 the relations between the approach proposed here and some of these
earlier approaches. We will first discuss what is the basic idea of the proposed approach. A more
formal presentation will follow in Section 2, using an implementation of these ideas that relies
on shared-parameter multi-layer neural networks. Another contribution of this paper concerns the
challenge of training such very large neural networks (with millions of parameters) for very large
data sets (with millions or tens of millions of examples). Finally, an important contribution of
this paper is to show that training such large-scale model is expensive but feasible, scales to large
contexts, andyieldsgoodcomparativeresults(Section4).

1.1 FightingtheCurseofDimensionalitywithDistributedRepresentations
Inanutshell, theideaoftheproposed approach canbesummarizedasfollows:
1. associate with each word in the vocabulary a distributed word feature vector (a real-
valuedvectorinRm),
2. express the joint probability function of word sequences in terms of the feature vectors
ofthesewordsinthesequence, and
3. learn simultaneously the word feature vectors and the parameters of that probability
function.
Thefeaturevectorrepresentsdifferentaspectsoftheword: eachwordisassociatedwithapoint
in a vector space. The number of features (e.g. m =30, 60 or 100 in the experiments) is much
smaller than the size of the vocabulary (e.g. 17,000). The probability function is expressed as a
product of conditional probabilities of the next word given the previous ones, (e.g. using a multi-
layer neural network to predict the next word given the previous ones, in the experiments). This
function has parameters that can be iteratively tuned in order to maximize the log-likelihood of
the training data or a regularized criterion, e.g. by adding a weight decay penalty.2 The feature
vectors associated with each word are learned, but they could be initialized using prior knowledge
ofsemanticfeatures.
Why does it work? In the previous example, if we knew that dog and cat played simi-
lar roles (semantically and syntactically), and similarly for (the,a), (bedroom,room), (is,was),

有许多方法被提出来解决这两个问题，我们将在第1.2节简要解释这里提出的方法与一些早期方法之间的关系。我们将首先讨论提议方法的基本思想。在第2节中将介绍更形式化的展示，使用一个依赖于共享参数多层神经网络的这些想法的实现。本文的另一个贡献涉及训练这样非常大的神经网络（具有数百万参数）用于非常大的数据集（具有数百万或数千万个例子）的挑战。最后，本文的一个重要贡献是表明训练这样大规模模型是昂贵但可行的，适用于大数据集，并产生良好的比较结果（第4节）。
本文中的许多操作都是采用矩阵表示，小写字母v表示一列向量和v的转置，A表示矩阵A的第j行，x.y=x0 y。
1.1 用分布式表示解决维度诅咒
简言之，提出方法的思想可以总结如下：
1. 为词汇表中的每个单词关联一个分布式词特征向量（一个在Rm中的实值向量），
2. 用这些单词在序列中的特征向量表示单词序列的联合概率函数，并
3. 同时学习单词特征向量和该概率函数的参数。
特征向量代表单词的不同方面：每个单词与向量空间中的一个点相关联。特征的数量（例如，在实验中 m=30，60或100）要远远小于词汇表的大小（例如，17000个）。概率函数表示为下一个单词在给定前几个单词的条件下的条件概率的乘积（例如，在实验中使用多层神经网络来预测在给定前几个单词的情况下的下一个单词）。这个函数有参数，可以通过迭代调整来最大化训练数据的对数似然或一个正则化准则（例如通过添加权值衰减惩罚）。与每个单词关联的特征向量是通过学习获得的，但也可以使用先验的语义特征进行初始化。
为什么它有效？在前面的例子中，如果我们知道dog和cat在语义和句法上扮演着相似的角色，同样对于（the，a），（bedroom，room），（is，was），

andmanyothercombinations. Intheproposedmodel,itwillsogeneralizebecause“similar”words

function of these feature values, a small change in the features will induce a small change in the
probability. Therefore, the presence ofonly oneofthe abovesentences inthetraining datawillin-

与先前工作的关系：
利用神经网络建模高维离散分布的想法已被证明对学习Z（1）、...、Z（n）的联合概率很有用，其中每一个都可能是不同性质的随机变量（Bengio和Bengio，2000a,b）。在该模型中，联合概率被分解为条件概率的乘积
P̂（Z1=z1, ..., Zn=zn）=ΠiP̂（Zi=zi|Zi-1=zi-1, Z1=z1），
其中g（.）是由具有特殊从左到右结构的神经网络表示的函数，第i个输出块g（）计算用于表示在具有任意顺序的以前的Z值之后给出Z的条件分布的参数。对四组UCI数据集的实验表明这种方法运转得相当好（Bengio和Bengio，2000a,b）。现在我们必须处理变长数据，例如句子，所以上述方法必须进行调整。另一个重要的区别是，这里所有的Z（在第i个位置的单词）都指向相同类型的对象（一个词）。因此，这里提出的模型引入了参数在时间上的共享 - 相同的g在时间上使用 - 以及在不同位置输入单词。这是同一概念的成功大规模应用，连同在连接主义早期就被提倡过的为符号化数据学习分布表示的（旧）想法（Hinton，1986年，Elman，1990年）。更近期，Hinton的方法得到了改进，并成功地在学习几个符号关系上进行了证明（Paccanaro和Hinton，2000）。利用神经网络进行语言建模的想法也不是新的（例如Miikkulainen和Dyer，1991）。与此相反，我们将这个想法推广到大规模，并集中于学习单词序列的分布统计模型，而不是学习单词在句子中的作用。这里提出的方法也与使用神经网络对基于字符的文本压缩的先前提议相关，用于预测下一个字符的概率（Schmidhuber，1996）。使用神经网络进行语言建模的想法也被Xu和Rudnicky（2000）独立提出，尽管实验使用的网络没有隐藏单元，并且只有一个输入词，这限制了模型基本上捕获了一元和二元统计。

从训练序列到新序列中获取一些单词之间的相似性，以获得泛化的想法并不是新的。例如，它在基于学习单词聚类的方法中被利用（Brownetal。，1992，Pereiraetal。，1993，Niesleretal。，1998，Baker1140）。

在信息检索领域（例如Schutze，1993年的工作）中，已经很好地利用了将单词表示为向量空间的概念，其中单词的特征向量是基于它们在同一文档中共同出现的概率来学习的（潜在语义索引，参见Deerwester等人，1990年）。一个重要的区别是，这里我们寻找一个有助于紧凑地表示自然语言文本中单词序列的概率分布的表示。实验表明，联合学习表示（单词特征）和模型是非常有用的。我们尝试（但没有成功）使用固定的单词特征表示每个单词，这些特征是与单词w周围文本中出现的单词的共现频率的第一个主成分相关的。这与LSI用于信息检索中对文档的做法类似。提出使用连续表示单词的概念在n-gram统计语言模型中成功利用了Bellegarda（1997）的方法，使用LSI动态地识别话题。
在神经网络中，将符号表示为向量空间的思想以前也曾以参数共享层的形式出现过（例如，Riis和Krogh，1996年，用于二级结构预测，以及Jensen和Riis，2000年用于文本到语音的映射）。
2.神经模型
训练集是一个单词序列w (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)w，其中w∈V，词汇表V是一个庞大但有限的集合。目标是学习一个良好的模型f(w t,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),w t−n+1)=Pˆ(w t|w t 1−1)，即在样本外似然性较高。下面，我们报告了1/Pˆ(w t|w t−1)的几何平均值，也称为困惑度，它也是平均负对数似然性的指数。模型的唯一约束是对于任何选择的wt 1−1，(cid:229) j∈V，f(i，w t−1，(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)，w t−n+1)=1，其中f>0。通过这些条件概率的乘积，可以得到单词序列的联合概率模型。
我们将函数f(w t,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),w t−n+1)=Pˆ(w t|w t 1−1)分解成两部分：
1. 从V中的任何元素i到实向量C(i)∈Rm的映射C。它代表词汇表中每个单词关联的分布特征向量。在实践中，C由一个自由参数的ajVj×m矩阵表示。
2. 通过C表达的单词的概率函数：一个函数g将上下文中单词的特征向量序列(C(w t−n+1)，(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)，C(w t−1))映射到V中下一个单词w的条件概率分布。g的输出是一个向量，其第i个元素估计了Pˆ(w=ijw t−1)，如图1所示。
f(i,w t−1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),w t−n+1)=g(i,C(w t−1),(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),C(w t−n+1))
函数f是这两个映射(C和g)的复合，其中C在整个上下文中是共享的。每个部分都与一些参数相关联。

be reduced to sub-linear if more sharing structure were introduced, e.g. using a time-delay neural
networkorarecurrent neuralnetwork(oracombination ofboth).
In most experiments below, the neural network has one hidden layer beyond the word features
mapping, and optionally, direct connections from the word features to the output. Therefore there
arereallytwohiddenlayers: thesharedwordfeatureslayerC,whichhasnonon-linearity (itwould
not add anything useful), and the ordinary hyperbolic tangent hidden layer. More precisely, the
neural network computes the following function, with a softmax output layer, which guarantees

映射C的参数只是特征向量本身，由矩阵C表示，其行i是单词i的特征向量C(i)。函数g可以通过前馈或循环神经网络或另一个参数化函数来实现，带有参数w。整体参数集合为q =(C,w)。

其中 R(q) 是一个正则项。例如，在我们的实验中，R是一个只应用于神经网络权重和C矩阵的权重衰减惩罚，而不应用于偏差。
在上述模型中，自由参数的数量与词汇表中单词的数量V以及顺序n线性相关。如果引入更多的共享结构，例如使用时延神经网络或循环神经网络（或两者的组合），则缩放因子可能会减小到亚线性。
在下面的大多数实验中，神经网络除了词特征映射之外还有一个隐藏层，并且可以选择将词特征直接连接到输出。因此，实际上有两个隐藏层：共享单词特征层C，其中没有非线性（这不会添加任何有用的内容），以及普通的双曲正切隐藏层。更准确地说，神经网络计算以下函数，具有softmax输出层，可以确保概率为1的正值和：

Althoughthenumberofparametersscalesnicely,i.e. linearlywiththesizeoftheinputwindowand
linearlywiththesizeofthevocabulary,theamountofcomputationrequiredforobtainingtheoutput
probabilities is much greater than that required from n-gram models. The main reason is that with
n-gram models, obtaining a particular P(w tjw t−1,...,w t−n+1) does not require the computation of
the probabilities for all the words in the vocabulary, because of the easy normalization (performed
when training the model) enjoyed by the linear combinations of relative frequencies. The main
computational bottleneck with the neural implementation is the computation of the activations of
theoutputlayer.

其中双曲正切tanh是逐元素应用的，W可选为零（无直接连接），x是单词特征层激活向量，是来自矩阵C的输入词特征的连接：
x=(C(w t−1),C(w t−2),...C(w t−n+1)).
设h为隐藏单元的数量，m为与每个单词相关联的特征数量。当不需要从单词特征到输出的直接连接时，将矩阵W设置为0。模型的自由参数是输出偏差b（具有jVej个元素）、隐藏层偏差d（具有h个元素）、隐藏到输出权重U（ajVj×hmatrix）、单词特征到输出权重W（ajVj×(n−1)m矩阵）、隐藏层权重H（ah×(n−1)m矩阵）和单词特征C（ajVj×m矩阵）：
q =(b,d,W,U,H,C).
自由参数的数量为jVj(1+nm+h)+h(1+(n−1)m)。主导因素是 jVj(nm+h)。请注意，理论上，如果权重W和H上有权重衰减而C上没有，那么W和H可能会收敛至零，而C会不断增大。在实践中，我们在使用随机梯度上升训练时并未观察到这种行为。

混合模型。在我们的实验中（见第4节），通过将神经网络的概率预测与插值三元模型的概率预测相结合，可以获得改进的性能，可以使用简单的固定权重0.5，学习权重（在验证集上最大似然）或一组与上下文频率有关的权重（使用与组合三元模型、二元模型和一元模型相同的程序在插值三元模型中组合）。
并行实现
尽管参数数量与输入窗口的大小线性缩放（与词汇量大小线性缩放），但获取输出概率所需的计算量远远大于n-gram模型所需的计算量。主要原因是，对于n-gram模型，获取特定的P(w tjw t−1,...,w t−n+1)不需要计算词汇表中所有单词的概率，这是由于线性组合相对频率时容易进行的归一化（在训练模型时执行）。神经实现的主要计算瓶颈是计算输出层的激活。

Runningthemodel(bothtrainingandtesting)onaparallelcomputerisawaytoreducecompu-
tation time. Wehaveexplored parallelization ontwotypesofplatforms: shared-memory processor
machinesandLinuxclusterswithafastnetwork.
3.1 Data-Parallel Processing
Inthecaseofashared-memory processor, parallelization iseasilyachieved, thanks totheverylow
communication overhead between processors, through the shared memory. In that case we have
chosen a data-parallel implementation in which each processor works on a different subset of
thedata. Eachprocessor computes thegradient foritsexamples, and performs stochastic gradient
updates on the parameters of the model, which are simply stored in a shared-memory area. Our
first implementation was extremely slow and relied on synchronization commands to make sure
that each processor would not write atthe same time asanother one in one ofthe above parameter
subsets. Mostofthe cycles ofeach processor werespent waiting foranother processor torelease a
lockonthewriteaccesstotheparameters.
Instead we have chosen an asynchronous implementation where each processor can write at
anytimeintheshared-memory area. Sometimes, part ofanupdate on theparameter vector byone
of the processors is lost, being overwritten by the update of another processor, and this introduces
a bit of noise in the parameter updates. However, this noise seems to be very small and did not
apparently slowdowntraining.
Unfortunately, large shared-memory parallel computers are very expensive and their processor
speed tends to lag behind mainstream CPUs that can be connected in clusters. We have thus been
abletoobtainmuchfastertraining onfastnetworkclusters.
3.2 Parameter-Parallel Processing
If the parallel computer is a network of CPUs, we generally can’t afford to frequently exchange
all the parameters among the processors, because that represents tens of megabytes (almost 100
megabytes in the case of our largest network), which would take too much time through a local
network. Instead we have chosen to parallelize across the parameters, in particular the parame-
ters of the output units, because that is where the vast majority of the computation is taking place,
in our architecture. Each CPU is responsible for the computation of the unnormalized probability
for a subset of the outputs, and performs the updates for the corresponding output unit parame-
ters (weights going into that unit). This strategy allowed us to perform a parallelized stochastic
gradientascentwithanegligiblecommunicationoverhead. TheCPUsessentiallyneedtocommu-
nicate two informations: (1) the normalization factor of the output softmax, and (2) the gradients
on the hidden layer (denoted a below) and word feature layer (denoted x). Allthe CPUsduplicate
the computations that precede the computation of the output units activations, i.e., the selection of
word features and the computation of the hidden layer activation a, as well as the corresponding
back-propagation and update steps. However, these computations are a negligible part of the total
computation forournetworks.

3.1 数据并行处理
在共享内存处理器的情况下，由于处理器之间的通信开销非常低，通过共享内存很容易实现并行化。在这种情况下，我们选择了数据并行实现，每个处理器在不同的数据子集上工作。每个处理器计算其示例的梯度，并对模型的参数执行随机梯度更新，这些参数简单地存储在共享内存区域中。我们的第一个实现非常慢，并且依赖于同步命令，以确保每个处理器不会与上述参数子集中的另一个处理器同时写入。每个处理器的大多数周期都花在等待另一个处理器释放对参数写入访问锁的时间上。
相反，我们选择了一个异步实现，其中每个处理器可以随时在共享内存区域中写入。有时，一个处理器对参数向量的更新的一部分会丢失，被另一个处理器的更新覆盖，这会在参数更新中引入一点噪音。然而，这种噪音似乎非常小，并且没有明显减慢训练速度。
不幸的是，大型共享内存并行计算机非常昂贵，它们的处理器速度往往落后于可以连接成集群的主流CPU。因此，我们已经能够在快速网络集群上获得更快的训练速度。
3.2 参数并行处理
如果并行计算机是多个CPU组成的网络，我们通常无法经常在处理器之间交换所有参数，因为这代表着数十兆字节（在我们最大的网络的情况下几乎达到100兆字节），通过局域网传输需要太长时间。相反，我们选择了跨参数进行并行化，特别是输出单元的参数，因为我们的架构中绝大部分计算发生在那里。每个CPU负责计算一部分输出的非归一化概率，并执行对应输出单元参数（进入该单元的权重）的更新。这种策略使我们能够进行带有可忽略通信开销的并行随机梯度上升。CPU基本上需要传达两个信息：（1）输出softmax的归一化因子，以及（2）隐藏层（表示为a）和单词特征层（表示为x）的梯度。所有CPU都复制出现在输出单元激活计算之前的计算，即单词特征的选择和隐藏层激活a的计算，以及相应的反向传播和更新步骤。然而，这些计算在我们的网络的总计算中只占很小一部分。
例如，考虑在AP（美联社）新闻数据实验中使用的以下架构：词汇量为|V|=17,964，隐藏单元数为h=60，模型的阶数为n=6，单词特征数为m=100。处理单个训练示例的总数值运算次数约为|V|(1+nm+h)+h(1+nm)+nm（其中术语分别对应于计算输出单元、隐藏单元和单词特征的计算）。

feature units). In this example the fraction of the overall computation required for computing the
weighted sums of the output units is therefore approximately jVj(1+(n−1)m+h) =
jVj(1+(n−1)m+h)+h(1+(n−1)m)+(n−1)m
99.7%. This calculation is approximate because the actual CPU time associated with different
operations differ, but it shows that it is generally advantageous to parallelize the output units com-
putation. ThefactthatallCPUswillduplicateaverysmallfractionofthecomputationsisnotgoing
to hurt the total computation time for the level of parallelization sought here, i.e. of a few dozen
processors. If the number of hidden units was large, parallelizing their computation would also
becomeprofitable, butwedidnotinvestigate thatapproach inourexperiments.

在上述实现中未显示权重衰减正则化，但可以很容易地加入（通过从每个参数中减去
权重衰减因子乘以学习率乘以参数值的结果，在每次更新时）。请注意，参数更新是直接
进行的，而不是通过参数梯度向量，以增加速度，计算速度的限制因素是内存访问，在我们
的实验中。
在前向阶段计算指数时可能存在数字问题，所有p都可能在数字上为零，或其中一个可能
对计算指数过大（见步骤1(c)ii）。为了避免这个问题，通常的解决方案是在softmax中取
指数之前先减去y 的最大值。因此，我们增加了一个额外的Allreduce操作，来在
j
处理器之间共享y 中的最大值，在计算指数之前。设q是第i块中y 的最大值。然后
j
总体最大值Q= max q被共同计算并在M个处理器之间共享。然后计算指数如下：
i i

（而不是步骤1(c)ii），以确保至少一个p是数字非零，并且指数参数的最大值为1。
通过将并行版本的时钟时间与单个处理器的时钟时间进行比较，我们发现通信开销
仅占总时间的1/15（对于一个训练时期）：因此，通过在快速网络上使用该算法进行并行
化，我们获得了几乎完美的加速。在网络速度较慢的集群上，可能仍然可以通过每K个示例
（一个小批次）执行通信来获得有效的并行化。这需要在每个处理器中存储神经网络的激活
和梯度的K个版本。在K个示例的前向阶段之后，概率总和必须在处理器之间共享。

4.实验结果
对Brown语料库进行了比较实验，该语料库是包含各种英语文本和书籍的1,181,041个单词的流。前80万单词用于训练，接下来的20万用于验证（模型选择，权重衰减，提前停止），剩下的181,041用于测试。不同的单词数量为47,578（包括标点符号，区分大小写，以及用于分隔文本和段落的句法标记）。频率为（cid：20）3的罕见单词合并为一个符号，将词汇量大小减少到jVj=16,383。
还对1995年和1996年的美联社（AP）新闻文本进行了实验。训练集包含约1400万（13,994,528）个单词的流，验证集包含约100万（963,138）个单词的流，测试集也包含约100万（963,071）个单词的流。原始数据有148,721个不同的单词（包括标点符号），通过仅保留最常见的单词并保留标点符号，将其减少到jVj=17964，将大写映射为小写，将数字形式映射到特殊符号，将罕见单词映射为特殊符号，并将专有名词映射为另一个专用符号。
对于训练神经网络，初始学习率设置为e = 10^-3（经过几次试验使用了一个微小数据集），并根据以下时间表逐渐降低：e = e o，其中t表示完成的参数更新次数，r是一种经验减少因子，被选择为r=10^-8。
4.1 N-Gram模型
神经网络与之进行比较的第一个基准是插值或平滑的三元模型（Jelinek和Mercer，1980）。让q
t
= l（freq（w t−1，w t−2））表示输入上下文（w t−1，w t−2）的离散发生频率。然后，条件概率估计具有以下形式的条件混合：
Pˆ（w tjw t−1，w t−2）=a 0（q t）p 0+a 1（q t）p 1（w t）+a 2（q t）p 2（w tjw t−1）+a 3（q t）p 3（w tjw t−1，w t−2）
其中条件权重a（q）(cid:21) 0,(cid:229) a（q ）= 1。基本预测器如下：p=
i t i i t 0
1/jVj，p（i）是一元（训练集中单词i的相对频率），p（ijj）是二元（前一个词为j时，单词i的相对频率），而p（ijj，k）是三元（前两个词为j和k时，单词i的相对频率）。动机是当（w t−1，w t−2）的频率很大时，p

是最可靠的，而当它较低时，p，甚至p的较低阶统计量p

A weight decay penalty of

was used in the Brown experiments and a weight decay of
10−5
wasused inthe APNewsexperiments (selected by afew trials, based on validation set perplexity).
Table 1 summarizes the results obtained on the Brown corpus. All the back-off models of the
table are modified Kneser-Ney n-grams, which worked significantly better than standard back-off
models. When m is specified for a back-off model in the table, a class-based n-gram is used (m
is the number of word classes). Random initialization of the word features was done (similarly to
initialization ofneuralnetworkweights),butwesuspectthatbetterresultsmightbeobtainedwitha
knowledge-based initialization.
The main result is that significantly better results can be obtained when using the neural net-
work,incomparisonwiththebestofthen-grams,withatestperplexitydifferenceofabout24%on

context (on Brown, going from 2 words of context to 4 words brought improvements to the neural
network, not to the n-grams). It also shows that the hidden units are useful (MLP3 vs MLP1 and
MLP4 vs MLP2), and that mixing the output probabilities of the neural network with the interpo-
lated trigram always helps to reduce perplexity. The fact that simple averaging helps suggests that
the neural network and the trigram make errors (i.e. lowprobability given to anobserved word) in

还与其他最先进的n-gram模型进行了比较：带有Modified Kneser-Ney算法（Kneser和Ney，1995，Chen和Goodman，1999）的回退n-gram模型，以及基于类的n-gram模型（Brown等，1992，Ney和Kneser，1993，Niesler等，1998）。验证集用于选择n-gram的顺序和基于类的模型的单词类别数。我们使用了SRILanguage Modeling工具包中Stolcke（2002）描述的算法实现，网址为www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/。它们用于计算下面报告的回退模型困惑度，需要注意的是，我们没有特别区分完整的句子标记在对数似然度量的计算中，正如我们的神经网络困惑度一样。所有标记（单词和标点符号）在计算对数似然度时都被视为相同（因此也会得到困惑度）。

4.2 结果
下面是不同模型测试集困惑度（1/Pˆ(w jwt−1)的几何平均）的度量结果。对于Brown语料库，随机梯度上升程序在大约10到20个epochs后显示了明显的收敛。在AP新闻语料库中，我们没有看到过拟合的迹象（在验证集上），可能是因为我们只运行了5个epochs（使用了40个CPU运行了3周）。在Brown实验中只有在必要时才使用了早停技术。Brown实验中使用了10^-4的权重衰减惩罚项，而AP新闻实验中使用了10^-5的权重衰减（通过几次试验后基于验证集困惑度选取的）。

表1总结了在Brown语料库上获得的结果。此表中的所有回退模型都是修改后的Kneser-Ney n-gram模型，比标准回退模型表现显著更好。表中指定m的回退模型时，使用了基于类的n-gram（m是单词类别数量）。初始化单词特征采用了随机初始化（类似于神经网络权重的初始化），但我们认为通过基于知识的初始化可能会取得更好的结果。

主要结果是，与最好的n-gram相比，使用神经网络可以取得显著更优异的结果，在Brown语料库上有约24%的测试困惑度差异，而在AP新闻上有约8%的差异，当使用在验证集上表现最好的MLP和n-gram时。表还表明神经网络能够利用更多的上下文（在Brown上，从2个单词的上下文扩展到4个单词会改善神经网络，但不会改善n-gram）。它还显示了隐藏单元的用处（MLP3对比MLP1和MLP4对比MLP2），以及将神经网络的输出概率与插值trigram混合总是有助于减少困惑度。简单平均有所帮助表明神经网络和trigram在不同的地方会出现错误（即对观察到的单词给出低概率）。结果并不允许得出直接从输入到输出的连接是否有用的结论，但建议在较小的语料库中至少可以获得更好的泛化能力而不需要直接输入到输出的连接，尽管训练时间更长：没有直接连接时，网络收敛需要的时间是原来的两倍（20次epoch而不是10），尽管困惑度稍微降低。一个合理的解释是，直接输入到输出的连接提供了更多的容量并更快地学习从单词特征到对数的“线性”映射。

Avariantoftheaboveneuralnetworkcanbeinterpretedasanenergyminimizationmodelfollowing
Hinton’srecent workonproducts ofexperts(Hinton, 2000). Intheneural networkdescribed inthe
previous sections the distributed word features are used only for the “input” words and not for the
“output” word (next word). Furthermore, a very large number of parameters (the majority) are
expanded in the output layer: the semantic or syntactic similarities between output words are not
exploited. In the variant described here, the output word is also represented by its feature vector.
The network takes in input a sub-sequence of words (mapped to their feature vectors) and outputs
an energy function E which is low when the words form a likely sub-sequence, high when it is
unlikely. Forexample,thenetworkoutputs an“energy” function

5.1 能量最小化网络
上述神经网络的变体可以解释为能量最小化模型，这是基于 Hinton 最近关于专家组的产品的工作（Hinton，2000）。在前面部分描述的神经网络中，分布式单词特征仅用于“输入”单词，而不用于“输出”单词（下一个单词）。此外，输出层扩展了非常大量的参数（大多数），输出单词之间的语义或语法相似性没有被利用。在此描述的变体中，输出单词也由其特征向量表示。网络输入单词子序列（映射到它们的特征向量）并输出一个能量函数 E，在单词形成可能的子序列时低，当不可能时高。例如，网络输出一个“能量”函数

E(w t−n+1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),w t)=v.tanh(d+Hx)+(cid:229) b
w t−i
i=0
其中 b 是偏置向量（对应于无条件概率），d 是隐藏单元偏置向量，v 是输出权重向量，H 是隐藏层权重矩阵，不同于前一模型，输入和输出单词共同贡献于 x：

x=(C(w t),C(w t−1),C(w t−2),(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),C(w t−n+1)。

能量函数 E(w t−n+1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),w t) 可以解释为(w t−n+1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),w t) 的未归一化对数概率。要获得条件概率 Pˆ(w t|w t−1,...,w t−n+1) 只需在可能的 w 值上进行归一化，如下：

Pˆ(w t|w t−1,...,w t−n+1)= e−E(w t−n+1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),w t) / Σ i e−E(w t−n+1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),w t−1,i)

请注意，总计算量与之前介绍的架构相当，并且如果 v 参数由目标词（w ）的身份索引，则参数数量也可以匹配。请注意，上述 softmax 归一化后仅保留 b（任何 w t−i 的线性函数对 i>0 被 softmax 归一化取消）。与之前一样，通过对 logPˆ(w t|w t−1,...,w t−n+1) 的随机梯度上升进行类似计算可以调整模型参数。在专家组的产品框架中，隐藏单元可被视为专家：子序列 (w t−n+1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),w t) 的联合概率与与每个隐藏单元 j 相关的术语的总和的指数成正比，v tanh(d +H x)。请注意，因为我们选择将整个序列的概率分解为每个元素的条件概率，所以
总体概率的计算量与之前的架构相当。

the computation of the gradient is tractable. This is not the case for example with products-of-
HMMs (Brown and Hinton, 2000), in which the product is over experts that view the whole se-
quence, and which can be trained with approximate gradient algorithms such as the contrastive
divergence algorithm (Brown and Hinton, 2000). Note also that this architecture and the products-
of-experts formulation can be seen as extensions of the very successful Maximum Entropy mod-
els (Berger et al., 1996), but where the basis functions (or “features”, here the hidden units acti-
vations) are learned by penalized maximum likelihood at the same time as the parameters of the
features linear combination, instead of being learned in an outer loop, with greedy feature subset
selection methods.
We have implemented and experimented with the above architecture, and have developed a
speed-up technique for the neural network training, based on importance sampling and yielding a
100-fold speed-up (BengioandSenécal, 2003).

梯度的计算是可行的。例如，在HMMs的乘积中（Brown和Hinton，2000），梯度的计算就不是这样的情况，其中的乘积是对查看整个序列的专家进行的，可以使用对比散度算法（Brown和Hinton，2000）等近似梯度算法进行训练。还要注意，这种结构和专家乘积的制定可以看作是非常成功的最大熵模型（Berger等，1996）的扩展，但这里的基础函数（或“特征”，这里指隐藏单元的激活）是通过惩罚最大似然学习的方式同时学习的，而不是通过贪婪的特征子集选择方法在外部环节学习。

我们已经实现并对上述结构进行了实验，并开发了一种神经网络训练加速技术，基于重要性抽样，可以实现100倍的加速（Bengio和Senécal，2003）。

未登录词。这种结构相对于前一种结构的优势是可以很容易地处理未登录词（甚至可以对其赋予概率）。主要思想是首先猜测这样一个词的初始特征向量，通过取可能出现在相同上下文中的其他词的特征向量的加权凸组合，权重与条件概率成正比。假设网络分配了一个概率Pˆ(ijwt−1)给上下文wt−1中的词i2V，并且在这个上下文中我们观察到一个新词j62V。我们将词j的特征向量C(j)初始化如下：C(j) = i2V C(i)Pˆ(ijwt t−1 −n+1)。然后我们可以将j纳入V并重新计算这个稍大的集合的概率（这只需要对所有单词进行归一化，除了单词i需要通过神经网络进行一次传递）。这个特征向量C(i)然后可以在尝试预测接下来的单词的概率时用于输入上下文部分。

未来的其他工作

在这项工作之后仍然有许多挑战需要解决。在短期内，需要设计和评估加速训练和识别方法。在长期内，需要介绍更多推广方法，除了这里利用的两种主要方法。以下是一些我们打算探索的想法：
1. 将网络拆分为子网络，例如使用单词的聚类。训练许多较小的网络应该更容易更快。
2. 用树结构表示条件概率，其中在每个节点应用一个神经网络，每个节点表示给定上下文的单词类别的概率，叶子表示给定上下文的单词的概率。这种表示方式有可能通过jVj/logjVj的因子来减少计算时间（参见Bengio，2002）。
3. 仅从输出单词的子集传播梯度。可以是条件上最有可能的单词（基于一个更快的模型，比如三元模型，参见Schwenk和Gauvain，2002，用于此思想的应用），或者可以是在三元模型表现不佳的单词子集。如果语言模型与语音识别器耦合，那么只需要计算声学上模糊的单词的得分（未归一化概率）。请参阅Bengio和Senécal（2003）了解一种使用重要性抽样选择单词的新加速训练方法。

4. Introducing a-priori knowledge. Severalformsofsuch knowledge could beintroduced, such
as: semantic information (e.g., from WordNet, see Fellbaum, 1998), low-level grammatical
information (e.g., using parts-of-speech), and high-level grammatical information, e.g., cou-
plingthemodeltoastochastic grammar,assuggested inBengio(2002). Theeffectoflonger
term context could be captured by introducing more structure and parameter sharing in the
neural network, e.g. using time-delay or recurrent neural networks. In such a multi-layered
networkthecomputationthathasbeenperformedforsmallgroupsofconsecutivewordsdoes
not need to be redone when the network input window is shifted. Similarly, one could use a
recurrentnetworktocapturepotentiallyevenlongerterminformationaboutthesubjectofthe
text.
5. Interpreting (and possibly using) the word feature representation learned by the neural net-
work. A simple first step would start with m = 2 features, which can be more easily dis-
played. Webelieve that more meaningful representations willrequire large training corpora,
especially forlargervaluesofm.
6. Polysemous words are probably not well served by the model presented here, which assigns
toeachwordasinglepointinacontinuoussemanticspace. Weareinvestigatingextensionsof
thismodelinwhicheachwordisassociatedwithmultiplepointsinthatspace,eachassociated
withthedifferent sensesoftheword.
6. Conclusion
The experiments on two corpora, one with more than a million examples, and a larger one with
above15millionwords,haveshownthattheproposed approach yields muchbetterperplexity than
astate-of-the-artmethod,thesmoothedtrigram,withdifferencesbetween10and20%inperplexity.
We believe that the main reason for these improvements is that the proposed approach allows
totake advantage ofthelearned distributed representation tofightthecurse ofdimensionality with
itsownweapons: each training sentence informs themodel about acombinatorial number ofother
sentences.
There is probably much more to be done to improve the model, at the level of architecture,
computational efficiency, andtakingadvantage ofpriorknowledge. Animportant priorityoffuture
research should be to improve speed-up techniques5 as well as ways to increase capacity without
increasingtrainingtimetoomuch(todealwithcorporawithhundredsofmillionsofwordsormore).

解释（并可能使用）神经网络学习的单词特征表示。一个简单的第一步可能是从m=2个特征开始，这样更容易显示。我们认为，要获得更有意义的表示需要大规模的训练语料库，特别是对于更大的m值。

这里提出的模型可能不适用于多义词，它将每个单词分配给连续语义空间中的一个点。我们正在研究此模型的扩展，其中每个单词与该空间中的多个点相关联，每个点与单词的不同意义相关联。

结论
对两个语料库进行的实验，其中一个有一百万个例子，另一个有超过一千五百万个单词，表明所提出的方法比现有技术的平滑三元组方法在困惑度方面要好得多，困惑度相差10%到20%。我们认为这些改进的主要原因是所提出的方法允许利用学习到的分布式表示来应对维度的诅咒，每个训练句子通知模型有关其他大量句子的组合数。

在模型的改进方面可能有很多工作要做，包括架构、计算效率，以及利用先验知识。未来研究的一个重要优先事项应该是改进加速技术，以及找到增加容量而不会增加太多训练时间的方法（以处理含有数亿甚至更多单词的语料库）。一个简单的想法是利用时间结构并扩大输入窗口的大小，可能包括整段文字（而不会增加太多参数或计算时间），是使用时间滞和可能循环的神经网络。对这里提出的模型在应用背景下的评估也将很有用，但请参考Schwenk和Gauvain（2002）已完成的工作，用于改善语音识别单词错误率。

更广泛地说，此处提出的工作为用分布表示替换“条件概率表”带来的统计语言模型的改进打开了大门，这种表示可以容纳更多的调节变量，远远超过以往。尽管在统计语言模型（例如随机语法）中已经花费了很多精力来限制或汇总调节变量，以避免过度拟合，但是现在可以通过分布表示来实现更紗和平滑的表征。Bengio和Senécal（2003）提出了一种百倍加速技术。
