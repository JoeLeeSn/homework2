 The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
“I’m not very hungry.”
“Come on and eat. You can’t fish and not eat.”
“I have,” the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it. Then
he started to fold the blanket.
“Keep the blanket around you,” the boy said. “You’ll not fish without eating while I’m
alive.”
“Then live a long time and take care of yourself,” the old man said. “What are we
eating?”
“Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew.”
[19] The boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the Terrace.
The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin
wrapped around each set.
“Who gave this to you?”
“Martin. The owner.”
“I must thank him.”
“I thanked him already,” the boy said. “You don’t need to thank him.”
“I’ll give him the belly meat of a big fish,” the old man said. “Has he done this for us
more than once?”
“I think so.”
“I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is very thoughtful for
us.”
“He sent two beers.”
“I like the beer in cans best.”
“I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the bottles.”
“That’s very kind of you,” the old man said. “Should we eat?”
“I’ve been asking you to,” the boy told him gently. “I have not wished to open the
container until you were ready.”
[20] “I’m ready now,” the old man said. “I only needed time to wash.”
Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was two streets
down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good
towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter
and some sort of shoes and another blanket.
